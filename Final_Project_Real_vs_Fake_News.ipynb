The debt was too staggering. By 2004, 365 stores had closed.\"', \"That the chain failed isn't in dispute: KB Toys went into bankruptcy in 2004 under Bain, later dissolving in bankruptcy court under different owners in 2008. But what drove it out of business?\", \"Romney's retirement\", 'The first two words in that quote, \"Romney and Bain,\" raise the first question: How was Romney involved with Bain in 2000?', 'He had retired from the firm in February 1999 to help organize the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics.', 'Charlyn Lusk, who does public relations for Bain, pointed to a fact-check this week by  Fortune  that said, \"Romney left Bain in 1999 and had no operational role thereafter. It is true that he remained an investor, but so did dozens of university endowments, private foundations and pension systems. None of them played a part in Bain\\'s investment decisions or portfolio company management.\"', 'But a  New York Times  report from December 2011 explains he had something more than investor status — he got a share of corporate buyout and investment profits \"enjoyed by partners from all Bain deals through February 2009. ... He was also given the right to invest his own money alongside his former partners.\"', 'A Bain partnership bought KB Toys in 2000, putting up $18 million and borrowing the rest, $302 million, the Times reported. Less than a year and a half later, KB Toys borrowed more to pay Bain and its investors — which would have included Romney — an $85 million dividend. (That dividend was part of a $121 million stock redemption, funded in part by $66 million in bank loans, Bloomberg reported based on other news coverage.) Bain partners made a 370 percent return, but left the company heavily in debt.', 'Did Romney lead the decision to buy KB Toys, and to reap a dividend? That\\'s what the wording \"Romney and Bain bought ...\" suggests. That\\'s highly unlikely, since he no longer led the firm. Still, he would have benefited from any deal that benefited the partners.', \"'The debt was too staggering'\", 'The video uses an old ad from KB Toys to paint a rosy picture. Puppets sing about a place with all the \"hottest toys.\"  (\"Hot we got at KB Toys!\") The ad uses a logo with the old \"Kay-Bee\" name, abandoned by the company in 1981 . Viewers are left to think that \"staggering debt\" drove a merry, healthy company into ruin.', \"Toy industry analysts paint a different picture. KB's model worked in the 1980s. But those puppets would have been crying by the late 1990s.\", '\"KB was for many years in a precarious position because of where it was in the industry. It wasn\\'t able to compete on price,\" said Sean McGowan a senior leisure and lifestyle analyst for Needham & Co. \"... If you layer on financial strain, that could push it to the breaking point.\"', 'The financial strain helped lead to the bankruptcy filing.', 'But even with no debt, it would have been losing money, said Jim Silver, editor-in-chief of Time to Play magazine.', '\"Their business model was obsolete,\" he said. \"The world had changed. KB had not changed.\"', 'Small mall toy stores, such as KB\\'s, couldn\\'t carry enough inventory — or stay tidy. But mall rents were high, and leases long, limiting KB\\'s ability to shift to compete with its larger rivals. Meanwhile, Target, Walmart and Toys \"R\" Us could carry far more toys and heavily discount the hottest merchandise.', \"KB's strategy at the time of the bankruptcy had been selling closeout toys at a discount — read: stuff that was no longer popular — and offering a few hot items at regular prices.\", '\"Knowing all these facts, why is the consumer going to go in there? Is it the higher prices or the old toys?\" Silver said.', \"KB wasn't the only toy store chain struggling. Time to Play made a list of 100 retailers around in the mid 1980s that no longer exist, Silver said.\", \"What about Bain's role?\", '\"To me, it\\'s almost irrelevant,\" Silver said. \"You take a business model that doesn\\'t work, it doesn\\'t matter how much money you have, or how much debt you have.\"', 'Closing stores', 'The video says, \"By 2004, 365 stores had closed.\"', \"We asked Rick Tyler, a spokesman for Winning Our Future, for support for the ad's claims. He sent us a single Associated Press article from Jan. 29, 2004.\", \"It reported KB's plans to cut 3,500 jobs and close at least 375 stores after a judge approved the chain's Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.\", 'The article said KB had filed to reorganize in January 2004, blaming \"the Christmas season\\'s sharp price wars and increased competition from mega-retailers like Wal-Mart.\" (The story didn\\'t mention the company\\'s debt burden.)', 'Chris Byrne, a toy industry analyst who wrote an \"obituary\" for KB Toys in 2008, notes that while the company did close 365 stores, it was part of a strategy that included expansion into KB Toy Works and KB Toys Outlet.', \"What killed the company wasn't so much its debt but poor strategy, he said.\", 'Bain and the new executive team had tried to walk away from KB\\'s closeout-old-toy strategy and compete with Toys \"R\" Us, Walmart and Target by selling new, hot toys at full markup, Byrne said. That resulted in a price war, forcing KB to lower its prices — and eroding margins. So the store tried to carry only a few hot toys, with closeout products in the back of the store.', '\"The numbers just wouldn\\'t work,\" he said. \"It was volume of toys and price as a function of square feet that, in my mind, really undid KB, not the taking of cash out by Bain. This is not the first time that a corporation has misread the toy industry.\"', '\"If the anti-Mitt Romney people were smarter ... they would be criticizing Bain for rushing into a business that it didn\\'t fully understand, looking for an outcome that probably wasn\\'t likely given the realities of the industry and its context at the time.\"', 'Still, was it a good idea to pull money out of a company struggling to find its place in a tough industry?', 'Roger Goddu, a former Toys \"R\" Us president who\\'s now in the private equity business, had invested in KB Toys and consulted for two years with new management in 2005.', '\"In hindsight, it\\'s possible that Bain may have taken a dividend on KB Toys that was too aggressive,\" Goddu said. \"However, the issues at KB Toys were not one-dimensional or purely financial.\"', 'What seemed like a decent idea could have quickly looked foolish, he said.', '\"In a highly competitive season, which happens in the toy business, the financial health of KB Toys could change quickly, and I suspect that\\'s indeed what happened,\" he said. \"What may have seemed okay could change in a very short period of time, based on other factors influencing KB\\'s operations.\"', \"Another private capital firm, Prentice Capital Management, bought KB Toys out of bankruptcy in 2005, ending Bain's reign. The toy store landed again in bankruptcy court in 2008, its stores gone by 2009.\"]  ...  ['“You know you’re going to bankrupt the country with health care, right?” talk show host Bill O’Reilly began as an introduction to talk with Sen. Hillary Clinton about her health care plan.', '“Oh, no, I’m not,” said Clinton, who appeared on the', 'The O’Reilly Factor', 'on April 30, 2008.', 'Clinton boiled her plan down to this: “Everybody who has health insurance who’s happy with it, you keep it. No changes. But what I am going to do is take an already existing plan -- it’s not government-run, it’s not a new bureaucracy. It’s the way Congress and federal employees get their health care. And we’re going to open it up to every American, because I think it’s about time...”', '“But you’re going to subsidize it,” O’Reilly interjected.', '“Well, we are,” Clinton said. “But here’s why. You already are subsidizing it. Your family policy has a $900 hidden tax. Why? Because when some poor person who doesn’t have health insurance...”', '“...goes to the emergency room...you’ve got to pick it up,” O’Reilly said, finishing her sentence.', 'The $900 figure is key to Clinton’s plan. Yes, she is saying, the government will subsidize her health care plan. But, the thinking goes, private insurance companies will charge lower premiums to their existing customers because they will no longer have to subsidize health care costs incurred by uninsured people.', 'Think of it like this, said John Sheils, senior vice president of The Lewin Group, a non-partisan group that has analyzed health care plans for both Democrats and Republicans: Someone shoplifts a loaf of bread from the grocery story. The price of bread is inflated a bit for everyone else to offset the store’s loss.', '“That’s kind of what’s going on with healthcare,” Sheils said.', 'Hospitals have to treat people who come in and need medical care. And if those people don’t pay, “it’s kind of like walking out of the story without paying for bread,” he said.', 'The cost is shifted onto those with private insurance.', 'Sheils said Clinton’s claim that family health insurance policies subsidize the uninsured to the tune of about $900 a year is “in the ballpark.” Sheils believes the number is a little lower, closer to $800 per year.', 'Hillary cites that same $900 figure in her formal health care proposal, the American Health Choices Plan.', '“One cause of the crisis in the health care system is that rather than containing costs, the system shifts them: about half of all hospital losses are passed along to other payers,” according to her plan. “Rather than reducing prices, the system raises families’ costs.', '“And, rather than covering all Americans, the system charges insured families a “hidden tax”: premiums are roughly $900 higher to pay for the cost of care for the uninsured.”', 'It cites a report from Families USA called “Paying a Premium: The added cost of care for the uninsured.” The report was based on an analysis of data by Kenneth E. Thorpe, former Clinton administration health expert, now a professor at Emory University.', 'Thorpe says Clinton’s figure actually is low.', 'According to his analysis, about $922 of a family policy was used to subsidize the uninsured in 2005. But the cost of health care has gone up since then, as have the number of uninsured. In 2008, the number is closer to $1,270, he said.', '“The only way for hospitals to offset the costs (of the uninsured) is to have private insurers pay more than it’s worth,” Thorpe said. “It is their only means to stay financially solvent.”', 'In 2005, private health paid about 25% more than the cost of care in hospitals, Thorpe said, citing a Medicare Payment Advisory Commission report to Congress.', 'O’Reilly didn’t contest Clinton’s numbers, but he did take umbrage with subsidizing other people’s health care.', '“I mean, I don’t want to be paying for someone who’s taking heroin and drinking a bottle of gin a day,” O’Reilly said.', '“But I assume you want to pay for some hardworking families whose kid has juvenile diabetes,” Clinton said. “Or some woman... that just gets diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis.\"', '“I don’t mind doing it,” O’Reilly said.', 'Clinton’s point was that, to an extent, family health policy holders already are shouldering some of the burden for the uninsured. There may be some debate about whether the number is exactly $900 a year, as she stated, but several health policy experts agreed that she’s at least close.']\n",

Despite the derision, the former governor of Maryland continues to stand by his talking point.\\n\"One of the things that preceded the failure of the nation-state of Syria and the rise of ISIS was the effect of climate change and the mega-drought that affected that region, wiped out farmers, drove people to cities, created a humanitarian crisis,\" O’Malley told Bloomberg TV on July 20.\\nTwo months later, O’Malley repeated his argument in an interview with the progressive radio show Democracy Now! on Sept. 10: \"Their government could not take care of the basic needs of families in those conditions. Civil war rose up as a result of protest and repression ... then the vacuum to that led to ISIS. So these are the cascading effects that happen in a world that’s very, very connected and in a world where climate change is now creating extreme weather conditions, prolonged droughts.\"\\nWith recent events -- the pope’s visit highlighting climate change and the United States’ decision to accept more Syrian refugees -- converging on the topic, we were curious if O’Malley’s claim really was \"absurd.\"\\nO’Malley’s source\\nA spokesperson for the O’Malley campaign told us that his source was a March 2015 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The study, which was well received in its field , does not mention ISIS at all, but its authors told us O’Malley’s extrapolation makes sense.\\nThe study found evidence that climate change led to an extreme drought in Syria’s breadbasket between 2006 to 2009. Food prices skyrocketed , nutrition-related diseases became widespread , and 1.5 million internal refugees abandoned their farms and flooded into Syrian cities already crowded with 1.5 million Iraqi refugees displaced by the Iraq war, according to the study.\\nThis influx of people exacerbated existing problems like unemployment, corruption and brewing discontent with the regime of Bashar al-Assad, which failed to respond to the situation, according to the study. In 2011, the unrest reached boiling point and erupted into the Syrian uprising.\\nIf we follow the sequence of events like O’Malley does, it’s reasonable to say the next fallen domino is the rise of ISIS.\\n\"Once the war had begun all sorts of pre-existing actors took advantage of the situation to pursue their goals -- ISIS was one and the collapse of Syria provided fertile ground for their actions,\" said co-author Richard Seager, a professor of climatology at Columbia University.\\nO’Malley’s campaign also forwarded us many reports and comments from the Department of Defense linking climate change and ISIS. We should also note that the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences study is not the first rigorous, academic investigation into the links between climate change and conflict (there’s at least one other on the Syrian conflict alone).\\nDrought’s not the sole culprit\\nIn the grander scheme of things, experts say, the drought was just one of many sparks that set the Syrian powder keg ablaze. But both the study and O’Malley acknowledge that and get credit for not overstating climate change’s impact.\\nWhile climate change may have played an indirect role in the Syrian uprising and ISIS’ rise, other causes – Assad’s recruitment of al-Qaeda members, the genocide against Sunni Arabs, etc.– are direct and \"crystal clear,\" according to Ali Khedery, a former special assistant to five American ambassadors in Iraq.\\nMichael Doran, a senior fellow on Middle East security issues at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank, pointed out that unrest in region is not confined to areas suffering from drought. He, however, said that O’Malley’s correct that the drought played a role in generating disaffection.\\n\"The drought did not cause the Syrian revolution or the fall of Assad,\" said Kenneth Pollack, a senior fellow on Middle East policy at the Brookings Institution. \"A very complex mix of factors did that, but the study suggests that climate change was part of that mix even if we can't tell how important it was.\"\\nThe study, which Pollack said is garnering a lot of attention among Middle East experts, notes that there is no single cause for conflict, while O’Malley emphasized the \"cascading effects\" of the drought, rather than the drought itself.\\n\"It's fair to say the uprising was going to happen at some point. But the drought did happen when it happened and based on the timing of it, the agricultural collapse and the migration were direct results,\" said study lead author Colin Kelley, a climatologist at the University of California at Santa Barbara. \"The drought creating this chaotic situation also created better opportunity for ISIS to thrive. If you say that in the way (O’Malley) said, it's fair to argue.\"  ...  “You know you’re going to bankrupt the country with health care, right?” talk show host Bill O’Reilly began as an introduction to talk with Sen. Hillary Clinton about her health care plan.\\n“Oh, no, I’m not,” said Clinton, who appeared on the\\nThe O’Reilly Factor\\non April 30, 2008.\\nClinton boiled her plan down to this: “Everybody who has health insurance who’s happy with it, you keep it. No changes. But what I am going to do is take an already existing plan -- it’s not government-run, it’s not a new bureaucracy. It’s the way Congress and federal employees get their health care. And we’re going to open it up to every American, because I think it’s about time...”\\n“But you’re going to subsidize it,” O’Reilly interjected.\\n“Well, we are,” Clinton said. “But here’s why. You already are subsidizing it. Your family policy has a $900 hidden tax. Why? Because when some poor person who doesn’t have health insurance...”\\n“...goes to the emergency room...you’ve got to pick it up,” O’Reilly said, finishing her sentence.\\nThe $900 figure is key to Clinton’s plan. Yes, she is saying, the government will subsidize her health care plan. But, the thinking goes, private insurance companies will charge lower premiums to their existing customers because they will no longer have to subsidize health care costs incurred by uninsured people.\\nThink of it like this, said John Sheils, senior vice president of The Lewin Group, a non-partisan group that has analyzed health care plans for both Democrats and Republicans: Someone shoplifts a loaf of bread from the grocery story. The price of bread is inflated a bit for everyone else to offset the store’s loss.\\n“That’s kind of what’s going on with healthcare,” Sheils said.\\nHospitals have to treat people who come in and need medical care. And if those people don’t pay, “it’s kind of like walking out of the story without paying for bread,” he said.\\nThe cost is shifted onto those with private insurance.\\nSheils said Clinton’s claim that family health insurance policies subsidize the uninsured to the tune of about $900 a year is “in the ballpark.” Sheils believes the number is a little lower, closer to $800 per year.\\nHillary cites that same $900 figure in her formal health care proposal, the American Health Choices Plan.\\n“One cause of the crisis in the health care system is that rather than containing costs, the system shifts them: about half of all hospital losses are passed along to other payers,” according to her plan. “Rather than reducing prices, the system raises families’ costs.\\n“And, rather than covering all Americans, the system charges insured families a “hidden tax”: premiums are roughly $900 higher to pay for the cost of care for the uninsured.”\\nIt cites a report from Families USA called “Paying a Premium: The added cost of care for the uninsured.” The report was based on an analysis of data by Kenneth E. Thorpe, former Clinton administration health expert, now a professor at Emory University.\\nThorpe says Clinton’s figure actually is low.\\nAccording to his analysis, about $922 of a family policy was used to subsidize the uninsured in 2005. But the cost of health care has gone up since then, as have the number of uninsured. In 2008, the number is closer to $1,270, he said.\\n“The only way for hospitals to offset the costs (of the uninsured) is to have private insurers pay more than it’s worth,” Thorpe said. “It is their only means to stay financially solvent.”\\nIn 2005, private health paid about 25% more than the cost of care in hospitals, Thorpe said, citing a Medicare Payment Advisory Commission report to Congress.\\nO’Reilly didn’t contest Clinton’s numbers, but he did take umbrage with subsidizing other people’s health care.\\n“I mean, I don’t want to be paying for someone who’s taking heroin and drinking a bottle of gin a day,” O’Reilly said.\\n“But I assume you want to pay for some hardworking families whose kid has juvenile diabetes,” Clinton said. “Or some woman... that just gets diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis.\"\\n“I don’t mind doing it,” O’Reilly said.\\nClinton’s point was that, to an extent, family health policy holders already are shouldering some of the burden for the uninsured. There may be some debate about whether the number is exactly $900 a year, as she stated, but several health policy experts agreed that she’s at least close.\n",

LeMieux never requested single earmark pushed ban all.\" broke claim two fact-checks. separate item explore claim that, \"Nelson voted billions wasteful spending earmarks like Bridge Nowhere. item, address second half equation, claim that, \"LeMieux never requested single earmark pushed ban all.\" technically true, contrast black-and-white ad suggests. Here's why: LeMieux appointed Senate then-Florida Gov. Charlie Crist fill remaining term retiring Sen. Mel Martinez. LeMieux took office Sept. 10, 2009, served Jan. 3, 2011. Soon taking office, LeMieux voted favor handful appropriations bills included thousands earmarks worth billions dollars. We'll break down. Oct. 15, 2009, LeMieux voted favor appropriations bill energy water development related agencies 2010 fiscal year. According Congressional Research Service report bill included 2,293 earmarks cost $5.7 billion. Oct. 6, 2009, Dec. 19, 2009, LeMieux voted favor appropriations bills Department Defense included 1,719 earmarks cost $4.2 billion.

Nov. 17, LeMieux voted favor appropriations bill military construction veterans affairs included 745 earmarks cost $14.5 billion. words, LeMieux voted bills containing billions dollars earmarks, thing ad criticized Nelson previous sentence. ad artfully worded. say LeMieux never voted earmark, says never requested single one. That's true, also true earmarks bound Florida already packed appropriations bills LeMieux took Martinez. checked earmark database 2010 fiscal year compiled Taxpayers Common Sense -- group tracks federal earmarks -- found several dozen earmarks cost hundreds millions dollars requested Martinez (sometimes jointly requested Nelson others) various Florida projects, included appropriations bills LeMieux voted for. find evidence LeMieux tried remove Florida earmarks. asked LeMieux votes via e-mail. \"I never requested earmark,\" LeMieux said. \"It became clear first couple months D.C., first appropriation bills, earmarks engine drive train increased spending. experience press conference Sens.

Again, wording earmark claims LeMieux's ad technically true. LeMieux personally requested earmarks, pushed ban all. think bit hypocritical LeMieux call Nelson voting bill included billions dollars worth earmarks (and specifically infamous Bridge Nowhere). LeMieux also voted bills included thousands earmarks worth billions dollars. logic LeMieux's ad, Nelson could counter ad says LeMieux voted billions earmarks including number outrageous-sounding pet projects around country included handful appropriations bills LeMieux voted late 2009. LeMieux makes distinction never personally requested earmarks (while Nelson certainly has). again, think worth noting appropriations bills LeMieux voted favor stuffed dozens Florida earmarks -- costing hundreds millions dollars -- requested Republican predecessor, Martinez. LeMieux put front issue reining earmarks, taking stand early 2010 calling complete ban. LeMieux may buy Nelson found religion earmarks, Nelson among half dozen Democrats Senate also voted earmark moratorium., \"(George) Soros Provides Migrants Prepaid Debit Cards Fund Illegal Journeys\" Conservative bloggers working overtime link liberal philanthropist George Soros thousands Hondurans left country trying get United States. attempt, headlines \"Soros Provides Migrants Prepaid Debit Cards Fund Illegal Journeys,\" posted News Punch Nov. 5. story talk Honduran migrants.

There’s plenty debate amendment says Constitution, we’ll visit later article. whether U.S. government says people put death, there’s long history federal executions. 37 federal prisoners executed since 1927, according U.S. Bureau Prisons. notable U.S. execution took place June 2001, Timothy McVeigh, convicted 1995 Oklahoma City federal building bombing killed 168 people, executed lethal injection federal prison Indiana. last federal execution 2003.

Sanders referring Republican Party Texas 2012 party platform spokesman Michael Briggs told PolitiFact email. noticed platform’s language called \"privatization\" government programs, never mentioned word \"abolish\" anything similar. GOP Texas Chairman Steve Munisteri said group support abolishment. \"To me, statements made grossly inaccurate,\" said. Let’s delve issue. Proposed Social Security changes Munisteri emphasized proposed Social Security changes would affect retirees near-retirees, already paid Social Security system. Then, younger people, platform calls \"transition system private pensions based concept individual retirement accounts.\" According previous proposed privatization plans, would entail individuals redirecting part current Social Security taxes personal account, would invested sort asset, said Michael Tanner, senior fellow libertarian Cato Institute specializes Social Security policy. \"They’re different programs, still exists mandatory, government-regulated retirement program,\" said. \"People would free invest brother-in-law’s South American gold mining stock.\" Former President George W.

There’s direct link scholarships public school budgets, Rubin said. Students would receive scholarships donations made corporations, use pay tuition public schools private schools. However, corporations would get tax credits return, make lost tax revenue, state would withhold aid students’ original school districts. phone interview, Rubin acknowledged process involving tax credits, argued public schools ultimately paying program. \"It’s like money laundering scheme,\" Rubin told us. \"It’s direct reduction school aid. schools paying it.\" Let’s explain proposed voucher program would work: Opportunity Scholarship Act part Gov. Chris Christie’s education reform agenda, legislation stalled Legislature since early year. two weeks ago, opponents supporters bill held competing rallies, one Jersey City one Trenton. current version Act would set five-year pilot program award scholarships public private school students residing 13 school districts failing schools, including Asbury Park Newark. Public school students would able leave districts attend school elsewhere. Three organizations throughout state would distribute scholarships parents guardians selected students. Corporations making donations scholarships would get tax credits worth 100 percent value donations, costing state millions’ worth tax revenue. That’s school aid dollars come in. According state’s nonpartisan Office Legislative Services, analyzed Senate version bill, nearly $1.2 billion state aid would initially withheld 13 districts course program. amount, $354 million would returned districts, according OLS. remaining roughly $840 million would retained state offset loss corporate business taxes, according OLS. So, scholarships would directly funded public school dollars, roundabout way, education aid would withheld cover tax credits granted donors providing scholarships. Adam Bauer, spokesman Republican state Sen.

President Barack Obama done recent campaign ad New Jersey Democratic State Committee latched onto new study Washington, D.C.-based Tax Policy Center. study says presumptive Republican presidential candidate’s proposals, wealthy taxpayers pay fewer taxes middle- lower-income taxpayers pay more. \"The non-partisan organization found Romney would raise taxes average middle class family $2,000 pay $5 trillion tax cuts millionaires billionaires,\" committee said Aug. 1 news release. Democrats right $2,000 tax hike average middle-class family, they’re wrong citing \"$5 trillion tax cuts millionaires billionaires.\" wealthy taxpayers would get tax break, much. First, let’s explain purpose behind study. Romney proposed various tax cuts, including 20 percent reduction federal income tax rates. Romney’s plan also allows certain tax benefits low-income households expire. changes would mean lower taxes income levels -- that’s candidate’s plan paid for. Romney campaign specified plan would offset tax revenue loss, Tax Policy Center study gives shot. short, tax cuts would require eliminating reducing certain tax deductions write-offs, according study. items include mortgage interest deductions education-related tax credits. Still, wealthy taxpayers, cost losing tax loopholes less money gained tax cuts. That’s they’re left net tax break. middle- lower-income folks, it’s way around. stand lose tax loopholes gain tax cuts, leaving greater tax bill end day. So, Democrats’ claim accurately makes overall point, wrongly compares $2,000 $5 trillion figures. Think apples-to-oranges comparison. factoring eliminating reducing tax loopholes, average tax hike 2015 would $2,000 taxpayers making less $200,000 year, also children. $5 trillion represents potential tax cuts 10-year period account eliminating reducing loopholes. Higher-income taxpayers would end net tax break, total savings would far less $5 trillion. Here’s number Democrats cited: taxpayers incomes exceeding $1 million, average, would get roughly $87,000 net tax break 2015. Take away tax loopholes, wealthy taxpayers would still get amount. It’s also worth noting Democrats wrong suggest \"millionaires billionaires\" would benefit Romney’s plan. wealthy taxpayers would receive greatest net tax savings, average taxpayers making $200,000 would benefit well. instance, taxpayers earning $200,000 $500,000, average, would receive net tax break roughly $1,800., \"(The farm bill) provision would many ways reduce deficit.\" Political pundits plenty controversies dish final Sunday news shows 2013.

Dave Brat wants rein federal funding public education. Brat, R-7th, backs Student Success Act, GOP bill would scale back Uncle Sam’s role overseeing public schools consolidate dozens federal education programs. Feb. 11, introduced successful amendment House Education Workforce Committee would require U.S. Department Education issue annual reports recommending ways save school spending. Brat, former college professor, expressed thoughts classical terms: \"The greatest thinkers Western Civ. products education policy,\" said. \"Socrates trained Plato rock Plato trained Aristotle, roughly speaking, rock. huge education funding necessary achieve greatest minds greatest intellects history.\" Five days later, Brat took Facebook posted view modern terms. \"Our government statistics show 30 years, federal spending education grown 375%, test scores remained flat,\" wrote. \"That proves throwing money education solution.\" wondered whether Brat’s Facebook post accurate, terms 30-year growth percentage federal education funding characterization test scores \"flat.\" Brian Gottstein, spokesman Bratt, said congressman’s statement based July 2012 testimony Neal McCluskey U.S. Senate education subcommittee. McCluskey, director Center Educational Freedom Cato Institute, libertarian think tank. said federal education cuts mandated sequestration -- Congress’s 2011 agreement chop domestic defense spending return raising nation’s borrowing limit -- \"are necessary overdue.\" McCluskey argued increasing school funding improved student performance. Let’s take closer look. Funding levels reading McCluskey’s testimony instantly turns inaccuracy Brat’s statement. McCluskey said 375 percent increase, adjusted inflation, occurred 40-year period 1970 2010. Brat posted increase occurred 30 years didn’t offer dates. McCluskey cited White House figures showing federal outlays elementary, secondary vocational education $2.9 billion 1970 rose $73.3 billion 2010. adjusted inflation, comes 375 percent increase. there’s issue using 2010 end date measuring growth. U.S. education spending hit record high 2010, bolstered $30 billion special stimulus money Washington sent states wake Great Recession help pay schools. stimulus program stopped last budget year -- ending Sept. 30, 2014 -- U.S. spent $40.8 billion education. Going back 30 years, Brat did, puts us 1984 federal spending schools $6.5 billion. Adjusted inflation, that’s 176 percent increase -- less half congressman’s figure. Now, let’s throw another factor: number students publicly-funded schools across nation increased 39.2 million 1984 projected 50 million 2014. Federal spending per student rose $165 1984 $816 2014. Adjusted inflation, that’s 117 percent increase -- less one-third Brat’s figure. note queried Brat’s office Feb. 16 Facebook post, spokesman Gottstein sent us Feb. 11 news release congressmen correctly said 375 increase education spending took place 40 years -- 1970 2010. public, however, doesn’t access detail. Brat’s congressional website doesn’t contain copy release, link Facebook post, says \"over 30 years, federal spending education grown 375 percent...\" used ellipsis. let’s look second part Brat’s statement. Test scores Brat’s claim test scores \"have flat\" comes McCluskey’s 2012 Senate testimony. McCluskey said 1970 2010, math reading scores National Assessment Educational Progress tests, \"have almost stagnant 17-year-olds, final product elementary secondary system.\" NAEP, frequently called \"The Nation’s Report Card,\" refers variety tests given every four years fourth, eighth twelfth graders sampling states. McCluskey focused \"long-term trend\" test 17-year-olds, since early 1970s measured achievement unchanged set math reading skills. first NAEP reading test, 1971, 17-year-olds average score 285 scale 500. recent test, 2012, average 287. first math test, 1973, average 304 inched 306 2012. scores don’t change much measure 30 years Brat mentions Facebook. average math score 1982 298 rose eight points next three decades. average reading score 1984 -- reading test wasn’t given 1982 -- 289 fell two points 2012. Brat hardly first call results 17-year-olds \"flat.\" Education Week, nationally-circulated periodical, used term 2009 headline describe history NAEP scores age group. chairman House Education Labor Committee year -- Rep.

Nov. 30, 2010, Senate, 73-25 vote, passed FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, landmark bill would expand food-safety regulations. House earlier passed different version, two chambers trying reconcile measures congressional session ends. Almost two weeks Senate passed version bill, Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., made floor speech critical bill. Nov. 18 speech, Coburn referred number deaths foodborne illnesses annually United States. \"The question is, stop 10 20 deaths year foodborne illness? that?\" Coburn asked. \"Well, physician trained epidemiology, could it. posit money would take billions upon billions upon billions additional dollars ever get there. find dilemma.\" number readers wrote us ask whether Coburn correct, citing widespread media references U.S. experiencing 5,000 foodborne-related deaths year. decided take closer look. 10 20 deaths year originates study federal Centers Disease Control Prevention. summary published August 13, 2010, edition CDC publication Morbidity Mortality Weekly Report study recaps number illnesses deaths caused 1,097 reported foodborne outbreaks 2007, recent year available. paper found outbreaks produced 21,244 cases foodborne illness 18 deaths. So, federal statistics show least 18 people died foodborne illness recent year statistics available. epidemiologists say statistic floor, ceiling, since several types foodborne deaths included number. merely deaths related outbreaks officially reported CDC. CDC says foodborne illness associated outbreaks, would therefore included outbreak numbers. inclusive way looking foodborne deaths comes Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network, FoodNet. That's program run CDC's Emerging Infections Program tracks foodborne illnesses 10 states, based laboratory results. 2009, FoodNet found 74 deaths caused 10 foodborne germs tracks. Since 10 FoodNet states account 15 percent population, \"a reasonable extrapolation would put close 500 deaths\" nationally, said Craig Hedberg, professor University Minnesota School Public Health. \"These real deaths associated confirmed illnesses. represents justifiable minimum floor\" number foodborne deaths every year. (There may overlap official outbreak deaths FoodNet-reported deaths, we'll use 500 deaths figure FoodNet own.) There's also second layer hidden foodborne deaths -- slip surveillance system tabulated foodborne deaths all. Many people foodborne illness don’t seek medical care, and, even do, may see doctor lab test ordered. steps needed FoodNet even hears case. lack lab testing means \"there usually way know whether (someone) got infection contaminated food another source,\" CDC epidemiologist Barbara Mahon told colleagues PolitiFact Texas September. \"Only part outbreak source determined -- usually less 5 percent cases Salmonella infection -- would possible know particular infection came from. Otherwise, might might foodborne.\" result, Mahon said, estimating true number Salmonella deaths due food requires looking \"many different kinds data multiple sources using appropriate statistical techniques adjust various sources infection under-diagnosis under-reporting.\" CDC currently working new estimate -- expected released soon, spokeswoman said, -- now, recent figures come 1999 paper. paper published CDC authored team led epidemiologist Paul S. Mead, included following estimate quoted countless times last decade -- \"76 million illnesses, 323,914 hospitalizations, 5,194 deaths year.\" numbers look quite specific, actually mask quite bit uncertainty. paper, authors note \"precise information food-related deaths especially difficult obtain pathogen-specific surveillance systems rarely collect information illness outcome, outcome-specific surveillance systems (e.g., death certificates) grossly underreport many pathogen-specific conditions.\" So, order estimate number deaths due foodborne bacteria, team calculated number deaths among reported bacterial cases, doubled figure account unreported deaths, multiplied percentage infections believed attributable foodborne transmission. represented good-faith effort estimate number foodborne deaths, still relied assumptions could -- -- challenged scientists. least one paper published CDC -- written Paul D. Frenzen, U.S. Department Agriculture demographer -- warned estimate \"inherently uncertain.\" fact, real number deaths, could accurately calculated, might either higher lower roughly 5,000 cited Mead's paper. \"The estimate deaths (in Mead paper) derived hospital discharge death certificate data deaths attributed gastroenteritis unknown cause,\" Frenzen wrote. \"Fatal illnesses due unknown foodborne agents always involve gastroenteritis, gastroenteritis may accurately diagnosed reported hospital charts death certificates. death estimate consequently omitted deaths unknown foodborne agents cause gastroenteritis likely overstated number deaths agents cause gastoenteritis.\" Hedberg, University Minnesota, agreed that, number foodborne deaths fluctuates year year, number may well lower 5,000 cited commonly media. However, added, certainly least 500 suggested tracking FoodNet. \"There doubt number much higher 10 20,\" said. experts agreed. \"There factual (or imagined) truth Sen. Coburn's comment,\" said Michael Osterholm, former Minnesota state epidemiologist. contacted Coburn's office, spokesman John Hart noted Coburn's broader point frequency foodborne illness decreasing time. \"In 1996, every 100,000 people country, 51.2 cases foodborne illness--the best world, far,\" Coburn said speech. \"But, 2009, 34.8 cases--three times better anybody else world. question asked: when, fact, trendline markedly decrease it? second question asked is: matter much money spend, diminishing return?\" fair questions, justify Coburn's later use lowball estimate deaths foodborne illness. would given credit he'd said 10 20 deaths per year officially declared outbreaks, even though still would misleading since official outbreaks represent fraction cases. also acknowledge reasonable scientists disagree whether Mead's team made right assumptions made calculations. Coburn's estimate also ignored much solid number -- number deaths estimated laboratory-confirmed data FoodNet. themselves, confirmed death figures FoodNet's 10 states roughly five times bigger Coburn's estimate, national approximation based numbers 25 times large., \"10 cents dollar Clinton Foundation goes charitable causes.\" vice presidential debate, Republican Mike Pence tried skewer Hillary Clinton talking multi-billion dollar Clinton Foundation.

One upshot: 627 boys, 6 percent group, accounted five offenses, according police reports. boys, Wolfgang wrote, collectively identified responsible 52 percent offenses recorded study and, said, two-thirds violent crimes believed committed juveniles.
