The debt was too staggering. By 2004, 365 stores had closed.\"', \"That the chain failed isn't in dispute: KB Toys went into bankruptcy in 2004 under Bain, later dissolving in bankruptcy court under different owners in 2008. But what drove it out of business?\", \"Romney's retirement\", 'The first two words in that quote, \"Romney and Bain,\" raise the first question: How was Romney involved with Bain in 2000?', 'He had retired from the firm in February 1999 to help organize the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics.', 'Charlyn Lusk, who does public relations for Bain, pointed to a fact-check this week by  Fortune  that said, \"Romney left Bain in 1999 and had no operational role thereafter. It is true that he remained an investor, but so did dozens of university endowments, private foundations and pension systems. None of them played a part in Bain\\'s investment decisions or portfolio company management.\"', 'But a  New York Times  report from December 2011 explains he had something more than investor status — he got a share of corporate buyout and investment profits \"enjoyed by partners from all Bain deals through February 2009. ... He was also given the right to invest his own money alongside his former partners.\"', 'A Bain partnership bought KB Toys in 2000, putting up $18 million and borrowing the rest, $302 million, the Times reported. Less than a year and a half later, KB Toys borrowed more to pay Bain and its investors — which would have included Romney — an $85 million dividend. (That dividend was part of a $121 million stock redemption, funded in part by $66 million in bank loans, Bloomberg reported based on other news coverage.) Bain partners made a 370 percent return, but left the company heavily in debt.', 'Did Romney lead the decision to buy KB Toys, and to reap a dividend? That\\'s what the wording \"Romney and Bain bought ...\" suggests. That\\'s highly unlikely, since he no longer led the firm. Still, he would have benefited from any deal that benefited the partners.', \"'The debt was too staggering'\", 'The video uses an old ad from KB Toys to paint a rosy picture. Puppets sing about a place with all the \"hottest toys.\"  (\"Hot we got at KB Toys!\") The ad uses a logo with the old \"Kay-Bee\" name, abandoned by the company in 1981 . Viewers are left to think that \"staggering debt\" drove a merry, healthy company into ruin.', \"Toy industry analysts paint a different picture. KB's model worked in the 1980s. But those puppets would have been crying by the late 1990s.\", '\"KB was for many years in a precarious position because of where it was in the industry. It wasn\\'t able to compete on price,\" said Sean McGowan a senior leisure and lifestyle analyst for Needham & Co. \"... If you layer on financial strain, that could push it to the breaking point.\"', 'The financial strain helped lead to the bankruptcy filing.', 'But even with no debt, it would have been losing money, said Jim Silver, editor-in-chief of Time to Play magazine.', '\"Their business model was obsolete,\" he said. \"The world had changed. KB had not changed.\"', 'Small mall toy stores, such as KB\\'s, couldn\\'t carry enough inventory — or stay tidy. But mall rents were high, and leases long, limiting KB\\'s ability to shift to compete with its larger rivals. Meanwhile, Target, Walmart and Toys \"R\" Us could carry far more toys and heavily discount the hottest merchandise.', \"KB's strategy at the time of the bankruptcy had been selling closeout toys at a discount — read: stuff that was no longer popular — and offering a few hot items at regular prices.\", '\"Knowing all these facts, why is the consumer going to go in there? Is it the higher prices or the old toys?\" Silver said.', \"KB wasn't the only toy store chain struggling. Time to Play made a list of 100 retailers around in the mid 1980s that no longer exist, Silver said.\", \"What about Bain's role?\", '\"To me, it\\'s almost irrelevant,\" Silver said. \"You take a business model that doesn\\'t work, it doesn\\'t matter how much money you have, or how much debt you have.\"', 'Closing stores', 'The video says, \"By 2004, 365 stores had closed.\"', \"We asked Rick Tyler, a spokesman for Winning Our Future, for support for the ad's claims. He sent us a single Associated Press article from Jan. 29, 2004.\", \"It reported KB's plans to cut 3,500 jobs and close at least 375 stores after a judge approved the chain's Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.\", 'The article said KB had filed to reorganize in January 2004, blaming \"the Christmas season\\'s sharp price wars and increased competition from mega-retailers like Wal-Mart.\" (The story didn\\'t mention the company\\'s debt burden.)', 'Chris Byrne, a toy industry analyst who wrote an \"obituary\" for KB Toys in 2008, notes that while the company did close 365 stores, it was part of a strategy that included expansion into KB Toy Works and KB Toys Outlet.', \"What killed the company wasn't so much its debt but poor strategy, he said.\", 'Bain and the new executive team had tried to walk away from KB\\'s closeout-old-toy strategy and compete with Toys \"R\" Us, Walmart and Target by selling new, hot toys at full markup, Byrne said. That resulted in a price war, forcing KB to lower its prices — and eroding margins. So the store tried to carry only a few hot toys, with closeout products in the back of the store.', '\"The numbers just wouldn\\'t work,\" he said. \"It was volume of toys and price as a function of square feet that, in my mind, really undid KB, not the taking of cash out by Bain. This is not the first time that a corporation has misread the toy industry.\"', '\"If the anti-Mitt Romney people were smarter ... they would be criticizing Bain for rushing into a business that it didn\\'t fully understand, looking for an outcome that probably wasn\\'t likely given the realities of the industry and its context at the time.\"', 'Still, was it a good idea to pull money out of a company struggling to find its place in a tough industry?', 'Roger Goddu, a former Toys \"R\" Us president who\\'s now in the private equity business, had invested in KB Toys and consulted for two years with new management in 2005.', '\"In hindsight, it\\'s possible that Bain may have taken a dividend on KB Toys that was too aggressive,\" Goddu said. \"However, the issues at KB Toys were not one-dimensional or purely financial.\"', 'What seemed like a decent idea could have quickly looked foolish, he said.', '\"In a highly competitive season, which happens in the toy business, the financial health of KB Toys could change quickly, and I suspect that\\'s indeed what happened,\" he said. \"What may have seemed okay could change in a very short period of time, based on other factors influencing KB\\'s operations.\"', \"Another private capital firm, Prentice Capital Management, bought KB Toys out of bankruptcy in 2005, ending Bain's reign. The toy store landed again in bankruptcy court in 2008, its stores gone by 2009.\"]  ...  ['“You know you’re going to bankrupt the country with health care, right?” talk show host Bill O’Reilly began as an introduction to talk with Sen. Hillary Clinton about her health care plan.', '“Oh, no, I’m not,” said Clinton, who appeared on the', 'The O’Reilly Factor', 'on April 30, 2008.', 'Clinton boiled her plan down to this: “Everybody who has health insurance who’s happy with it, you keep it. No changes. But what I am going to do is take an already existing plan -- it’s not government-run, it’s not a new bureaucracy. It’s the way Congress and federal employees get their health care. And we’re going to open it up to every American, because I think it’s about time...”', '“But you’re going to subsidize it,” O’Reilly interjected.', '“Well, we are,” Clinton said. “But here’s why. You already are subsidizing it. Your family policy has a $900 hidden tax. Why? Because when some poor person who doesn’t have health insurance...”', '“...goes to the emergency room...you’ve got to pick it up,” O’Reilly said, finishing her sentence.', 'The $900 figure is key to Clinton’s plan. Yes, she is saying, the government will subsidize her health care plan. But, the thinking goes, private insurance companies will charge lower premiums to their existing customers because they will no longer have to subsidize health care costs incurred by uninsured people.', 'Think of it like this, said John Sheils, senior vice president of The Lewin Group, a non-partisan group that has analyzed health care plans for both Democrats and Republicans: Someone shoplifts a loaf of bread from the grocery story. The price of bread is inflated a bit for everyone else to offset the store’s loss.', '“That’s kind of what’s going on with healthcare,” Sheils said.', 'Hospitals have to treat people who come in and need medical care. And if those people don’t pay, “it’s kind of like walking out of the story without paying for bread,” he said.', 'The cost is shifted onto those with private insurance.', 'Sheils said Clinton’s claim that family health insurance policies subsidize the uninsured to the tune of about $900 a year is “in the ballpark.” Sheils believes the number is a little lower, closer to $800 per year.', 'Hillary cites that same $900 figure in her formal health care proposal, the American Health Choices Plan.', '“One cause of the crisis in the health care system is that rather than containing costs, the system shifts them: about half of all hospital losses are passed along to other payers,” according to her plan. “Rather than reducing prices, the system raises families’ costs.', '“And, rather than covering all Americans, the system charges insured families a “hidden tax”: premiums are roughly $900 higher to pay for the cost of care for the uninsured.”', 'It cites a report from Families USA called “Paying a Premium: The added cost of care for the uninsured.” The report was based on an analysis of data by Kenneth E. Thorpe, former Clinton administration health expert, now a professor at Emory University.', 'Thorpe says Clinton’s figure actually is low.', 'According to his analysis, about $922 of a family policy was used to subsidize the uninsured in 2005. But the cost of health care has gone up since then, as have the number of uninsured. In 2008, the number is closer to $1,270, he said.', '“The only way for hospitals to offset the costs (of the uninsured) is to have private insurers pay more than it’s worth,” Thorpe said. “It is their only means to stay financially solvent.”', 'In 2005, private health paid about 25% more than the cost of care in hospitals, Thorpe said, citing a Medicare Payment Advisory Commission report to Congress.', 'O’Reilly didn’t contest Clinton’s numbers, but he did take umbrage with subsidizing other people’s health care.', '“I mean, I don’t want to be paying for someone who’s taking heroin and drinking a bottle of gin a day,” O’Reilly said.', '“But I assume you want to pay for some hardworking families whose kid has juvenile diabetes,” Clinton said. “Or some woman... that just gets diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis.\"', '“I don’t mind doing it,” O’Reilly said.', 'Clinton’s point was that, to an extent, family health policy holders already are shouldering some of the burden for the uninsured. There may be some debate about whether the number is exactly $900 a year, as she stated, but several health policy experts agreed that she’s at least close.']\n",

Despite the derision, the former governor of Maryland continues to stand by his talking point.\\n\"One of the things that preceded the failure of the nation-state of Syria and the rise of ISIS was the effect of climate change and the mega-drought that affected that region, wiped out farmers, drove people to cities, created a humanitarian crisis,\" O’Malley told Bloomberg TV on July 20.\\nTwo months later, O’Malley repeated his argument in an interview with the progressive radio show Democracy Now! on Sept. 10: \"Their government could not take care of the basic needs of families in those conditions. Civil war rose up as a result of protest and repression ... then the vacuum to that led to ISIS. So these are the cascading effects that happen in a world that’s very, very connected and in a world where climate change is now creating extreme weather conditions, prolonged droughts.\"\\nWith recent events -- the pope’s visit highlighting climate change and the United States’ decision to accept more Syrian refugees -- converging on the topic, we were curious if O’Malley’s claim really was \"absurd.\"\\nO’Malley’s source\\nA spokesperson for the O’Malley campaign told us that his source was a March 2015 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The study, which was well received in its field , does not mention ISIS at all, but its authors told us O’Malley’s extrapolation makes sense.\\nThe study found evidence that climate change led to an extreme drought in Syria’s breadbasket between 2006 to 2009. Food prices skyrocketed , nutrition-related diseases became widespread , and 1.5 million internal refugees abandoned their farms and flooded into Syrian cities already crowded with 1.5 million Iraqi refugees displaced by the Iraq war, according to the study.\\nThis influx of people exacerbated existing problems like unemployment, corruption and brewing discontent with the regime of Bashar al-Assad, which failed to respond to the situation, according to the study. In 2011, the unrest reached boiling point and erupted into the Syrian uprising.\\nIf we follow the sequence of events like O’Malley does, it’s reasonable to say the next fallen domino is the rise of ISIS.\\n\"Once the war had begun all sorts of pre-existing actors took advantage of the situation to pursue their goals -- ISIS was one and the collapse of Syria provided fertile ground for their actions,\" said co-author Richard Seager, a professor of climatology at Columbia University.\\nO’Malley’s campaign also forwarded us many reports and comments from the Department of Defense linking climate change and ISIS. We should also note that the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences study is not the first rigorous, academic investigation into the links between climate change and conflict (there’s at least one other on the Syrian conflict alone).\\nDrought’s not the sole culprit\\nIn the grander scheme of things, experts say, the drought was just one of many sparks that set the Syrian powder keg ablaze. But both the study and O’Malley acknowledge that and get credit for not overstating climate change’s impact.\\nWhile climate change may have played an indirect role in the Syrian uprising and ISIS’ rise, other causes – Assad’s recruitment of al-Qaeda members, the genocide against Sunni Arabs, etc.– are direct and \"crystal clear,\" according to Ali Khedery, a former special assistant to five American ambassadors in Iraq.\\nMichael Doran, a senior fellow on Middle East security issues at the Hudson Institute, a conservative think tank, pointed out that unrest in region is not confined to areas suffering from drought. He, however, said that O’Malley’s correct that the drought played a role in generating disaffection.\\n\"The drought did not cause the Syrian revolution or the fall of Assad,\" said Kenneth Pollack, a senior fellow on Middle East policy at the Brookings Institution. \"A very complex mix of factors did that, but the study suggests that climate change was part of that mix even if we can't tell how important it was.\"\\nThe study, which Pollack said is garnering a lot of attention among Middle East experts, notes that there is no single cause for conflict, while O’Malley emphasized the \"cascading effects\" of the drought, rather than the drought itself.\\n\"It's fair to say the uprising was going to happen at some point. But the drought did happen when it happened and based on the timing of it, the agricultural collapse and the migration were direct results,\" said study lead author Colin Kelley, a climatologist at the University of California at Santa Barbara. \"The drought creating this chaotic situation also created better opportunity for ISIS to thrive. If you say that in the way (O’Malley) said, it's fair to argue.\"  ...  “You know you’re going to bankrupt the country with health care, right?” talk show host Bill O’Reilly began as an introduction to talk with Sen. Hillary Clinton about her health care plan.\\n“Oh, no, I’m not,” said Clinton, who appeared on the\\nThe O’Reilly Factor\\non April 30, 2008.\\nClinton boiled her plan down to this: “Everybody who has health insurance who’s happy with it, you keep it. No changes. But what I am going to do is take an already existing plan -- it’s not government-run, it’s not a new bureaucracy. It’s the way Congress and federal employees get their health care. And we’re going to open it up to every American, because I think it’s about time...”\\n“But you’re going to subsidize it,” O’Reilly interjected.\\n“Well, we are,” Clinton said. “But here’s why. You already are subsidizing it. Your family policy has a $900 hidden tax. Why? Because when some poor person who doesn’t have health insurance...”\\n“...goes to the emergency room...you’ve got to pick it up,” O’Reilly said, finishing her sentence.\\nThe $900 figure is key to Clinton’s plan. Yes, she is saying, the government will subsidize her health care plan. But, the thinking goes, private insurance companies will charge lower premiums to their existing customers because they will no longer have to subsidize health care costs incurred by uninsured people.\\nThink of it like this, said John Sheils, senior vice president of The Lewin Group, a non-partisan group that has analyzed health care plans for both Democrats and Republicans: Someone shoplifts a loaf of bread from the grocery story. The price of bread is inflated a bit for everyone else to offset the store’s loss.\\n“That’s kind of what’s going on with healthcare,” Sheils said.\\nHospitals have to treat people who come in and need medical care. And if those people don’t pay, “it’s kind of like walking out of the story without paying for bread,” he said.\\nThe cost is shifted onto those with private insurance.\\nSheils said Clinton’s claim that family health insurance policies subsidize the uninsured to the tune of about $900 a year is “in the ballpark.” Sheils believes the number is a little lower, closer to $800 per year.\\nHillary cites that same $900 figure in her formal health care proposal, the American Health Choices Plan.\\n“One cause of the crisis in the health care system is that rather than containing costs, the system shifts them: about half of all hospital losses are passed along to other payers,” according to her plan. “Rather than reducing prices, the system raises families’ costs.\\n“And, rather than covering all Americans, the system charges insured families a “hidden tax”: premiums are roughly $900 higher to pay for the cost of care for the uninsured.”\\nIt cites a report from Families USA called “Paying a Premium: The added cost of care for the uninsured.” The report was based on an analysis of data by Kenneth E. Thorpe, former Clinton administration health expert, now a professor at Emory University.\\nThorpe says Clinton’s figure actually is low.\\nAccording to his analysis, about $922 of a family policy was used to subsidize the uninsured in 2005. But the cost of health care has gone up since then, as have the number of uninsured. In 2008, the number is closer to $1,270, he said.\\n“The only way for hospitals to offset the costs (of the uninsured) is to have private insurers pay more than it’s worth,” Thorpe said. “It is their only means to stay financially solvent.”\\nIn 2005, private health paid about 25% more than the cost of care in hospitals, Thorpe said, citing a Medicare Payment Advisory Commission report to Congress.\\nO’Reilly didn’t contest Clinton’s numbers, but he did take umbrage with subsidizing other people’s health care.\\n“I mean, I don’t want to be paying for someone who’s taking heroin and drinking a bottle of gin a day,” O’Reilly said.\\n“But I assume you want to pay for some hardworking families whose kid has juvenile diabetes,” Clinton said. “Or some woman... that just gets diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis.\"\\n“I don’t mind doing it,” O’Reilly said.\\nClinton’s point was that, to an extent, family health policy holders already are shouldering some of the burden for the uninsured. There may be some debate about whether the number is exactly $900 a year, as she stated, but several health policy experts agreed that she’s at least close.\n",

Neither of those languages are exclusive to one country, as Swahili is also spoken in a number of different African nations.\\nA search of multiple Swahili dictionaries turned up no results for the word \"Denali.\"\\nAs our fact-checker friends at Snopes found , the Swahili word for \" black \" is \"mweusi,\" and the Swahili word for power is \"nguvu.\"\\nThat doesn’t amount to \"Denali,\" which has roots in the word \"Deenaalee\" in Koyukon, a native language of Alaska currently spoken by just 300 people . Koyukon is part of the Athabaskan language family, which also includes Navajo and several Apache languages native to the American Southwest.\\n\"Deenaalee\" approximately translates to \"the High One,\" according to James Fall, an official at Alaska’s Department of Fish and Game, and James Kari, a linguist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks’ Native Language Center.\\nObama called the name change \"a step to reflect the heritage of Alaska Natives.\"\\nWhile the meme’s claim is ridiculous, we were able to verify that the viral image does depict the real Denali .</th>\n",

              "      <th>\" 'Scary' fact about our national debt. In 1791 it was $75 million. Today, it rises by that amount in about an hour.\" Adam Hasner, a Republican U.S. Senate candidate and former Florida House Majority leader, is a big fan of Twitter. He uses his account ( @adamhasner ) as a campaign tool to chat with supporters and flaunt his conservative credentials.\\nIt's not unexpected that he used the venue to sound off on a popular GOP target: the country's ever-increasing national debt.\\nThe debt exceeds $14 trillion.\\nHasner tweeted at least three statements on the topic from May 10 to May 12, 2011.\\n• \"Scary\" fact about our national debt. In 1791 it was $75 million. Today, it rises by that amount in about an hour www.attackthedebt.com • \"Scary\" fact #2 Post WW2 national debt was 122% of GDP, by 1970 it was down to 38%, now it's 95% of GDP www.attackthedebt.com • Debt more than doubled since '00, increased 41% in just 3 years under Pres Obama. Both parties to blame. www.attackthedebt.com\\n\"Scary\" facts, huh? Labels such as that practically beg for closer scrutiny.\\nWe decided to investigate the first claim, which required a little arithmetic. Does the debt really grow at $75 million an hour today?\\nWe also took a quick look at claims No. 2 and 3, just to be thorough. They were easy to verify through federal websites. For \"Scary Fact #2,\" we looked at the Office of Management and Budget tables showing the debt as a percent of GDP. In 1946, the total federal debt was 121.7 percent of GDP. In 1970, it was 37.6 percent, and now (for 2010), it's 93.2 percent. Those are close enough to Hasner's numbers.\\nFor his third claim, we checked the same link. From the end of fiscal year 2000 (Sept. 30, 2000) through fiscal year 2010 (Sept. 30, 2010), the total debt rose 140 percent, more than doubled, so Hasner's right on that part. We switched to the U.S. Department of the Treasury's website to check the change since Barack Obama became president because that site lists a daily amount for the debt. From inauguration day on Jan. 20, 2009, when the debt was $10.627 trillion, to May 12, when it was $14.308 trillion, the increase is about 35 percent. Not quite the 41 percent Hasner cites, but also close.\\nSo let's go back to our fact-check on his first tweet.\\nDebt history\\nThe first part of this tweet is easy to check out. The Treasury Department website goes back to Jan. 1, 1791 -- the earliest date available -- when the historical debt outstanding was $75,463,476.52.\\nSo, Hasner was right about that too.\\nBut how did he determine the rate at which the debt increases today? We asked Rick Wilson, his Republican campaign consultant, to explain the math.\\nIt turns out Hasner, um, borrowed all three claims from CBS MoneyWatch.com story posted in November 2010, called \"18 Scary US Debt Facts.\"\\nThe claim we're checking from Hasner is the first to appear in Jill Schlesinger's story. She provides a link to the website of Ed Hall, who runs an online Debt Clock and appears to be the original source of this factoid (his debt clock was not working as of May 19, 2011, and the FAQ link was also inaccessible at times).\\nHall, a software engineer from California, said he started the website in 1995 as a lesson in Web programming. He couches his statement a little bit more than either the MoneyWatch story or Hasner by adding \"or so\" at the end.\\nIn an e-mail, Hall wrote: \"That number is out of date (it was correct at the time I wrote it) but now the National Debt rises by about $165 million per hour. I get this by dividing the average daily debt increase over the past few years ($4.02 billion) by 24.\"\\nOur math\\nHasner tweeted his claim on May 10, 2011. That's important because he says the debt rises by $75 million in about an hour \"today.\"\\nWe looked at the rate at which the debt increased from April 10 to May 10, 2011.\\nTo do that, we used very precise numbers provided by the Treasury's \"Debt to the Penny and Who Holds it\" feature, which allows you to look up the daily total U.S. public debt for any date since March 31, 2005. We'll provide the long numbers so you can follow along.\\nFor April 10, 2011, that number was $14,265,383,134,019.53\\nFor May 10, 2011, it was $14,331,522,797,881.61\\nThe difference between those figures, which tells us how much the debt grew over 30 days, is $66,139,663,862.08.\\nDivide that by 30 and you learn the debt increased by $2,204,655,462 a day. That sum divided by 24 is $91,860,644.25, which exceeds Hasner's figure of about $75 million an hour.\\nFor more context, we applied the same method to Oct. 18, 2010, and Nov. 18, 2010 (the day the CBS MoneyWatch story was published).\\nOct. 18: $13,668,894,473,093.42\\nNov. 18: $13,788,455,142,118.05\\nUsing the same method, but dividing by 31 days instead of 30, we found the hourly debt increase to be $160,669,824. That's closer to the amount gleaned with Hall's method.\\nAs you see, the rate the debt grows can vary month to month and year to year. It depends on how big the budget deficit is at any point in time. (The debt, as explained here , is the sum of all past deficits.)</th>\n",

Among those charges for which they were convicted was waterboarding.\" The morning after the CNN/YouTube debate in St. Petersburg, John McCain remained firm in his stand against the use of an interrogation technique called \"waterboarding.\" He cited solid history to buttress his position.\\n\"I forgot to mention last night that following World War II war crime trials were convened. The Japanese were tried and convicted and hung for war crimes committed against American POWs. Among those charges for which they were convicted was waterboarding,\" he told reporters at a campaign event.\\n\"If the United States is in another conflict ... and we have allowed that kind of torture to be inflicted upon people we hold captive, then there is nothing to prevent that enemy from also torturing American prisoners.\"\\nMcCain is referencing the Tokyo Trials, officially known as the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. After World War II, an international coalition convened to prosecute Japanese soldiers charged with torture. At the top of the list of techniques was water-based interrogation, known variously then as \"water cure,\" \"water torture\" and \"waterboarding,\" according to the charging documents. It simulates drowning.\\nR. John Pritchard, a historian and lawyer who is a top scholar on the trials, said the Japanese felt the ends justified the means. \"The rapid and effective collection of intelligence then, as now, was seen as vital to a successful struggle, and in addition, those who were engaged in torture often felt that whatever pain and anguish was suffered by the victims of torture was nothing less than the just deserts of the victims or people close to them,\" he said.\\nIn a recent journal essay, Judge Evan Wallach, a member of the U.S. Court of International Trade and an adjunct professor in the law of war, writes that the testimony from American soldiers about this form of torture was gruesome and convincing. A number of the Japanese soldiers convicted by American judges were hanged, while others received lengthy prison sentences or time in labor camps.</th>\n",

              "      <th>\" ‘Obamacare’ puts the federal government between you and your doctor.\" The Republican position on the health care law is that it represents a government takeover of the health care system. In his response to the Supreme Court ruling to uphold the law, Mitt Romney stayed on message. \"Perhaps most troubling of all, Obamacare puts the federal government between you and your doctor,\" Romney said .\\nThis is a slightly different version of the broader statement about a government takeover, which PolitiFact has repeatedly found to be false and sometimes outrageously so. In fact, that claim was PolitiFact’s 2010 Lie of the Year . We will try to set the record straight on this particular assertion.\\nWe asked the Romney campaign to explain exactly how the Affordable Care Act puts the government between patient and doctor. We did not hear back, and Romney did not elaborate in his original comments.\\nThe overarching fact about the law is that it relies on the private sector. Employers still buy private health insurance for their workers. The law doesn’t change how much doctors are paid or what services they can provide, though it does create incentives and penalties to promote better care. (One example: It penalizes hospitals if patients are re-admitted soon after being discharged.)\\nIt establishes a minimum benefits package for insurance plans and fosters competition among health insurance companies by creating shopping websites. These sites, called exchanges, will allow customers to pick insurance plans the same way they might buy other things online, such as refrigerators or airplane tickets.The law also gives subsidies to people of limited means so they can buy their own insurance.\\nIf the health care law did get between doctors and patients, you would think most doctors would complain loudly. While some do, the leading physician advocacy group, the American Medical Association, does not. On the contrary, the AMA supports the law.\\nAfter the Supreme Court upheld the health reform act, AMA president Jeremy Lazarus issued a statement praising the decision, because the law \"will allow patients to see their doctors earlier rather than waiting for treatment until they are sicker and care is more expensive.\"\\nLazarus doesn’t see the law making life harder for doctors; he sees it making life easier. He said it \"simplifies administrative burdens, including streamlining insurance claims, so physicians and their staff can spend more time with patients and less time on paperwork.\"\\nBeyond the AMA, about nine other physician advocacy groups back all or major portions of the reform law , including the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Cardiology.\\nSpecialists tend to be more concerned about the impact of health care reform than the primary doctors, and that chiefly centers on the Medicare program.\\nThe law sets up a panel to keep Medicare spending in check. The 15-member panel is called the Independent Payment Advisory Board and starting in 2020, it can recommend changes in reimbursement rates and other cost-saving measures. Health reform law opponents sometimes speak of this panel as a backdoor to rationing, but as PolitiFact has noted many times , claims about the IPAB are often exaggerated.\\nThe law specifically prohibits the panel from suggesting anything that leads to rationing or reductions in either benefits or eligibility. Further, Congress has the power to overrule the panel’s recommendations.\\nThe law’s significant changes in the health insurance market are another source of concern.\\nDr. Dick Armstrong, the chief operating officer of Docs4PatientCare , a group opposed to the law, says Washington will be able to define the best practices for treating patients. The government would enforce those guidelines through the insurance companies and require them to reimburse only that care that matches those best practices. Armstrong said this will \"shut out\" doctors who don’t follow those rules.\\n\"Best practice guidelines can reduce costs,\" Armstong said. \"But guidelines become dangerous in the hands of people who tie them to money.\"\\nThe law is sweeping and is designed to have an effect on the quality and cost of care. But to assume that the outcomes will only be negative requires a very selective reading of federal law that overlooks many checks on federal authority.\\nFirst, Washington has given states the authority to set the standards for insurance plans so they can respond to local conditions.\\nSecond, the law calls for creation of \"strategies to align public and private payers with regard to quality and patient safety efforts,\" and insurance company participation in those exchanges is part of that effort. But the law also expressly allows insurance plans to operate outside the exchanges.\\nThird, the strongest federal efforts to control spending lie in the federal Medicare program, not in the private market. Within Medicare, participation in the biggest cost-saving pilot -- Accountable Care Organizations -- is voluntary. The Accountable Care Organizations are intended to bring doctors and specialists together to treat patients and include financial incentives.\\nFourth, all regulations must pass through an extensive public review process.\\nWe came across one opinion poll that showed doctors evenly split on the broad question of whether the health reform law is a step in the right or the wrong direction. However, the poll’s methodology raised some red flags. It reached out to about 16,000 doctors, but only about 500 responded. In that group, specialists outnumbered primary care doctors two to one. The specialists overall were much more likely to worry that reform would drive their pay down. Surgical specialists were the most likely to say that health reform was a step in the wrong direction.</th>\n",

I am the guy that got under her skin and provoked that infamous response from Hillary Clinton by asking a pretty simple question, 'Why didn't you just pick up the phone and call the survivors’ (of the Benghazi attack)?\"  Johnson said. \"Instead of doing that, she hatched a cover-up story and repeatedly lied to the American people.\"\\nIs that how their exchange unfolded?\\nWe found that Johnson is accurately recounting the testimony, but being selective. Clinton’s answer was longer and more nuanced.\\nDuring a January 2013 Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Johnson did repeatedly press Clinton about not making contact with Americans in Benghazi to \"ascertain immediately that there was no protest.\" Clinton did give her exasperated answer (which has been hashtagged and criticized ).\\n\"Ron's questioning from start to finish was about how a simple phone call could have led to the truth — a fact that clearly got under Secretary Clinton's skin just as he described,\" Brian Reisinger, Johnson’s spokesman, told us.\\nBut Johnson’s account requires some more context, as Clinton answered the senator’s question twice before her infamous comment.\\nHere is a transcript of their exchange , per PolitiFact Wisconsin , with the parts Johnson highlighted in bold:\\nJohnson: \"Okay, when you read the ARB (State Department Accountability Review Board), it strikes me as how certain the people were that the attacks started at 9:40 Benghazi time. When was the first time you spoke to — or have you ever spoken to — the returnees, the evacuees? Did you personally speak to those folks?\"\\nClinton: \"I‘ve spoken to one of them, but I waited until after the ARB had done its investigation because I did not want there to be anybody raising any issue that I had spoken to anyone before the ARB conducted its investigation.\"\\nJohnson: \"How many people were evacuated from Libya?\"\\nClinton: \"Well, the numbers are a little bit hard to pin down because of our other friends — \"\\nJohnson: \"Approximately?\"\\nClinton: \"Approximately, 25 to 30.\"\\nJohnson: \"Did anybody in the State Department talk to those folks very shortly afterwards?\"\\nClinton: \"There was discussion going on afterwards, but once the investigation started, the FBI spoke to them before we spoke to them, and so other than our people in Tripoli — which, I think you’re talking about Washington, right?\"\\nJohnson: \"The point I’m making is, a very simple phone call to these individuals, I think, would’ve ascertained immediately that there was no protest prior to this. This attack started at 9:40 p.m. Benghazi time, and it was an assault. I appreciate the fact that you called it an assault. But I’m going back to then-Ambassador (Susan) Rice five days later going on the Sunday shows and, what I would say, is purposefully misleading the American public. Why wasn’t that known? And again, I appreciate the fact that the transparency of this hearing, but why weren’t we transparent to that point in time?\"\\nClinton: \"Well, first of all, senator, I would say that once the assault happened, and once we got our people rescued and out, our most immediate concern was, number one, taking care of their injuries. As I said, I still have a DS (Diplomatic Security) agent at Walter Reed seriously injured — getting them into Frankfurt, Ramstein to get taken care of, the FBI going over immediately to start talking to them. We did not think it was appropriate for us to talk to them before the FBI conducted their interviews. And we did not — I think this is accurate, sir — I certainly did not know of any reports that contradicted the IC (Intelligence Community) talking points at the time that Ambassador Rice went on the TV shows. And you know I just want to say that people have accused Ambassador Rice and the administration of misleading Americans. I can say trying to be in the middle of this and understanding what was going on, nothing could be further from the truth. Was information developing? Was the situation fluid? Would we reach conclusions later that weren’t reached initially? And I appreciate the — \"\\nJohnson: \"But, Madame Secretary, do you disagree with me that a simple phone call to those evacuees to determine what happened wouldn’t have ascertained immediately that there was no protest? That was a piece of information that could have been easily, easily obtained?\"\\nClinton: \"But, senator, again — \"\\nJohnson: \"Within hours, if not days?\"\\nClinton: \"Senator, you know, when you’re in these positions, the last thing you want to do is interfere with any other process going on, number one — \"\\nJohnson: \"I realize that’s a good excuse.\"\\nClinton: \"Well, no, it’s the fact. Number two, I would recommend highly you read both what the ARB said about it and the classified ARB because, even today, there are questions being raised. Now, we have no doubt they were terrorists, they were militants, they attacked us, they killed our people. But what was going on and why they were doing what they were doing is still unknown —\"\\nJohnson: \"No, again, we were misled that there were supposedly protests and that something sprang out of that — an assault sprang out of that — and that was easily ascertained that that was not the fact, and the American people could have known that within days and they didn’t know that.\"\\nClinton: \"With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they’d they go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, senator. Now, honestly, I will do my best to answer your questions about this, but the fact is that people were trying in real time to get to the best information. The IC has a process, I understand, going with the other committees to explain how these talking points came out. But you know, to be clear, it is, from my perspective, less important today looking backwards as to why these militants decided they did it than to find them and bring them to justice, and then maybe we’ll figure out what was going on in the meantime.\"\\nJohnson: \"Okay. Thank you, Madame Secretary.\"\\nSo the transcript makes a few points fairly clear:\\nJohnson was the guy who got Clinton riled up by asking why she didn’t call Benghazi survivors;\\nClinton did say \"What difference at this point does it make?\" in response to that question.\\nBut Clinton also did provide Johnson other answers. She said her priority was figuring out how to rescue those still at the compound and how to treat their injuries, not pressing them for information. She said it wasn’t appropriate for the State Department to talk to them before FBI interviews. Finally, she said her department and the administration were still trying to sort out the confusion in the days following the attacks.</th>\n",

Bobby Scott, D-Va., recently criticized President Donald Trump for not taking the Covid-19 pandemic \"seriously.\"\\nAs proof, Scott cited the critical lack of test kits in the United States despite almost two months of warnings early this year before the disease hit American shores.\\n\"If you line up all the countries that have done testing on a per capita basis, we’re at the bottom of the list,\" Scott said during an April 2 radio interview on the conservative John Fredericks Show based in Portsmouth.\\nGovernors from both parties and health-care experts have complained that the lack of Covid-19 tests has hampered efforts to combat the disease. Trump has said things have picked up and the U.S. has now conducted more tests than any nation. PolitiFact has debunked a similar Trump claim, noting that the U.S. has a high population and it lags in the key comparison measurement - the number of conducted tests per capita.\\nBut we wondered whether the U.S. really is at the bottom of nations in per capita testing, as Scott said. So we did a fact check.\\nStatistical stew\\nLet’s start by emphasizing that global comparisons of Covid-19 testing are tenuous because nations measure it differently.\\nOur World in Data , a research organization funded by philanthropists Bill and Melinda Gates, collects statistics from 50 nations and notes some countries count the total number of tests performed, others report the number of people tested, others tally the number of tests that have been analyzed. The organization says for many nations, it’s unclear what method is used. The group says the varied reporting does not produce \"meaningful comparisons\" of nations.\\nThe U.S. does not have a central source of statistics on testing, most of which is done by private labs . A widely-cited unofficial count comes from The Covid Tracking Project , a data set that journalists and scientists collect statistics from states and localities - which also have different ways of compiling numbers.\\nScott’s proof\\nWe asked Scott’s press office for the source of the congressman’s claim that the U.S. ranks last among testing nations. We were sent a March 12, 2020 Vox article with a chart showing the U.S. had conducted only 23 Covid-19 tests per 1 million people. That was the fewest among eight comparison nations: Japan, the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Israel, Taiwan, Italy, South Korea and the Guangdong Province of China.\\nVox said it drew its statistics from a variety of sources, including the Covid Tracking Project. Even if we overlook the difficulties in comparing testing data, a huge problem remains: Scott was using March 12 figures to describe the situation on April 2 - the day of his interview.\\nConditions change fast with the coronavirus. The U.S. had conducted 10,262 tests through March 12, according to Tracking Project estimates . By April 2, it was up to 1.3 million. On the day Scott made his statement, Vox put a note on its three-week-old article saying there had been \" significant developments in the coronavirus pandemic since this story was last updated, and details may no longer apply.\"\\nAs of April 13, the project estimated the U.S. had run 2.9 million tests.\\nVox no longer ranks the U.S. last in per capita testing. On April 13, it placed the U.S. fifth among nine nations: Italy, Germany, Canada, South Korea, Netherlands, U.K., France and Taiwan.</th>\n",

Now O’Brien is holding secret meetings with big developers.\" Building permits, secret meetings and big developers – oh my!\\nSayreville voters should keep those concerns in mind, if a political mailer circulating in town – complete with marquee-style lettering and an exclamation point or two -- is to be believed.\\n\"Since Mayor O’Brien took office Sayreville has issued 22,081 Building Permits! Now O’Brien is Holding Secret Meetings with Big Developers\" reads a large postcard mailed to residents in this small Middlesex County borough. The postcard shows a man attempting to climb a small mountain of paperwork – presumably applications to build in the borough. A large headshot of O’Brien, a Republican, is in the background. The postcard states that it’s paid for and authorized by the New Jersey Democratic State Committee. O'Brien is seeking re-election to a four-year term. His opponent is Democrat Stanley Drwal.\\nAlthough the ad doesn’t specifically state it, the inference from the ad is there’s a lot of building going on under O’Brien’s watch. And building can be a dirty verb in New Jersey. For some people, it means more children in schools, more government services needed and less open space – all costing more tax dollars.\\nPolitiFact New Jersey checked the claims in the ad and found that the number of building permits issued during O’Brien’s 11-year tenure as mayor is correct – but only about 5 percent of those were to construct homes. As for secret meetings? That depends on who’s asked.\\n\"This is a personal attack,\" O’Brien said about the ad. \"It’s personal and it’s misleading. They must think the people of Sayreville are stupid. We only have about 11,000 homes in Sayreville.\"\\nActually, the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Fact Finder survey for 2010 shows Sayreville has 16,393 housing units. The Census Bureau defines a housing unit as \"a house, an apartment, a mobile home or trailer, a group of rooms, or a single room occupied as separate living quarters, or if vacant, intended for occupancy as separate living quarters,\" spokeswoman Stacey Gimbel Vidal said in an email.\\nAn ad doesn’t have to make a specific statement for its intent to be clear, according to Dr. Terry Madonna, a political science professor at Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa.\\n\"When I look at things I try to look at the whole picture,\" Madonna said. \"What meaning are they trying to convey consciously and subconsciously?\"\\nThe Democratic State Committee sent an Open Public Records Act request to the borough on Sept. 20, seeking the number of building permits issued in Sayreville from Jan. 1, 2000 to Sept. 20, 2011. O'Brien became mayor in 2000.\\nKirk Miick, the borough’s construction official and director of code enforcement, said he contacted the organization and asked if a breakdown was wanted of what the permits were for, and was told that just a total number of permits issued was needed.\\nMiick told PolitiFact New Jersey the borough issued 22,081 permits during the requested timeframe but noted that of those, about 1,240 were for new homes – single-family residences, condominiums and townhouses. Another 3,026 were for significant additions or modifications to existing houses, while the rest were permits for demolition work, pools, sheds, fences, warehouses, educational facilities and more.\\nNow, about those \"secret\" meetings.\\nJason Springer, communications director for the Democratic State Committee, provided us with copies of news stories and a letter from the Middlesex County Prosecutor’s Office relating to a February 2010 incident in which O’Brien showed up at a meeting at the Woodbridge Hilton between Deborah Lee and Robert Kaye of the development firm PRC Group. Lee, an alternate on the Planning Board, was at the meeting as president of the Spinnaker Pointe Homeowners Association. When O’Brien showed up -- unexpectedly, according to Lee -- she asked that the discussion not include matters to be brought before the Planning Board.\\nA portion of the meeting recorded on tape was later found to have been deleted. The Middlesex County Prosecutor’s Office investigated and determined that a crime had been committed – tampering with public records and information -- but had no suspects and closed the investigation without filing criminal charges. The prosecutor’s office then made a number of recommendations about better securing future recordings of public meetings.\\nO’Brien, who owns a sales and marketing agency, said the meeting was not held secretly. O’Brien said he travels frequently for work and often conducts borough business where a meeting is convenient – a practice he has done since he’s been mayor.\\n\"If I can meet somebody at a restaurant I’ll meet them at a restaurant, I’ll meet them in a lobby of a hotel on a parkway -- wherever I am and wherever they are, I meet with them, at borough hall and all points in between,\" he said.\\nO’Brien said Councilwoman Lisa Eicher, a Democrat, filed an ethics complaint against him with the state Department of Community Affairs, regarding the meeting. We checked with the state for the status of the complaint.\\n\"For reasons of confidentiality, we can neither confirm nor deny the receipt of an ethics complaint,\" DCA spokeswoman Lisa Ryan said in an email. \"Ethics complaints are only subject to public disclosure 30 days after mailing a notice of dismissal or a notice of violation to the individual named in a complaint and the complainant.\"\\nWe also asked Springer about evidence of other alleged secret meetings that O’Brien supposedly had, since the wording of the mailer indicates more than one, and that such meetings are continuing.\\n\"If the Mayor told us he was holding additional secret meetings, they wouldn’t be very secret,\" Springer responded in an email. \"However, one has to assume so, otherwise why would someone go through such great lengths to erase evidence of the first meeting.\"\\nSpringer also questioned the appropriateness of doing borough business outside Sayreville.\\n\"Meetings with a developer should take place in Borough Hall, not in a hotel in another town,\" he said.  \"The very nature of the meeting, with the surprise appearance of the Mayor was highly inappropriate.  And again, if there was nothing to the meeting, why would someone go through such great lengths to erase part of the recording?\"</th>\n",

              "The first part of this tweet is easy to check out. The Treasury Department website goes back to Jan. 1, 1791 -- the earliest date available -- when the historical debt outstanding was $75,463,476.52.\n",
              "So, Hasner was right about that too.\n",
              "But how did he determine the rate at which the debt increases today? We asked Rick Wilson, his Republican campaign consultant, to explain the math.\n",
              "It turns out Hasner, um, borrowed all three claims from CBS MoneyWatch.com story posted in November 2010, called \"18 Scary US Debt Facts.\"\n",
              "The claim we're checking from Hasner is the first to appear in Jill Schlesinger's story. She provides a link to the website of Ed Hall, who runs an online Debt Clock and appears to be the original source of this factoid (his debt clock was not working as of May 19, 2011, and the FAQ link was also inaccessible at times).\n",
              "Hall, a software engineer from California, said he started the website in 1995 as a lesson in Web programming. He couches his statement a little bit more than either the MoneyWatch story or Hasner by adding \"or so\" at the end.\n",
              "In an e-mail, Hall wrote: \"That number is out of date (it was correct at the time I wrote it) but now the National Debt rises by about $165 million per hour. I get this by dividing the average daily debt increase over the past few years ($4.02 billion) by 24.\"\n",
              "Our math\n",
              "Hasner tweeted his claim on May 10, 2011. That's important because he says the debt rises by $75 million in about an hour \"today.\"\n",
              "We looked at the rate at which the debt increased from April 10 to May 10, 2011.\n",
              "To do that, we used very precise numbers provided by the Treasury's \"Debt to the Penny and Who Holds it\" feature, which allows you to look up the daily total U.S. public debt for any date since March 31, 2005. We'll provide the long numbers so you can follow along.\n",
              "For April 10, 2011, that number was $14,265,383,134,019.53\n",
              "For May 10, 2011, it was $14,331,522,797,881.61\n",
              "The difference between those figures, which tells us how much the debt grew over 30 days, is $66,139,663,862.08.\n",
              "Divide that by 30 and you learn the debt increased by $2,204,655,462 a day. That sum divided by 24 is $91,860,644.25, which exceeds Hasner's figure of about $75 million an hour.\n",
              "For more context, we applied the same method to Oct. 18, 2010, and Nov. 18, 2010 (the day the CBS MoneyWatch story was published).\n",
              "Oct. 18: $13,668,894,473,093.42\n",
              "Nov. 18: $13,788,455,142,118.05\n",
              "Using the same method, but dividing by 31 days instead of 30, we found the hourly debt increase to be $160,669,824. That's closer to the amount gleaned with Hall's method.\n",
              "As you see, the rate the debt grows can vary month to month and year to year. It depends on how big the budget deficit is at any point in time. (The debt, as explained here , is the sum of all past deficits.), \" ... following World War II war crime trials were convened. The Japanese were tried and convicted and hung for war crimes committed against American POWs. Among those charges for which they were convicted was waterboarding.\" The morning after the CNN/YouTube debate in St. Petersburg, John McCain remained firm in his stand against the use of an interrogation technique called \"waterboarding.\" He cited solid history to buttress his position.\n",
              "\"I forgot to mention last night that following World War II war crime trials were convened. The Japanese were tried and convicted and hung for war crimes committed against American POWs. Among those charges for which they were convicted was waterboarding,\" he told reporters at a campaign event.\n",
              "\"If the United States is in another conflict ... and we have allowed that kind of torture to be inflicted upon people we hold captive, then there is nothing to prevent that enemy from also torturing American prisoners.\"\n",
              "McCain is referencing the Tokyo Trials, officially known as the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. After World War II, an international coalition convened to prosecute Japanese soldiers charged with torture. At the top of the list of techniques was water-based interrogation, known variously then as \"water cure,\" \"water torture\" and \"waterboarding,\" according to the charging documents. It simulates drowning.\n",
              "R. John Pritchard, a historian and lawyer who is a top scholar on the trials, said the Japanese felt the ends justified the means. \"The rapid and effective collection of intelligence then, as now, was seen as vital to a successful struggle, and in addition, those who were engaged in torture often felt that whatever pain and anguish was suffered by the victims of torture was nothing less than the just deserts of the victims or people close to them,\" he said.\n",
              "In a recent journal essay, Judge Evan Wallach, a member of the U.S. Court of International Trade and an adjunct professor in the law of war, writes that the testimony from American soldiers about this form of torture was gruesome and convincing. A number of the Japanese soldiers convicted by American judges were hanged, while others received lengthy prison sentences or time in labor camps., \" ‘Obamacare’ puts the federal government between you and your doctor.\" The Republican position on the health care law is that it represents a government takeover of the health care system. In his response to the Supreme Court ruling to uphold the law, Mitt Romney stayed on message. \"Perhaps most troubling of all, Obamacare puts the federal government between you and your doctor,\" Romney said .\n",
              "This is a slightly different version of the broader statement about a government takeover, which PolitiFact has repeatedly found to be false and sometimes outrageously so. In fact, that claim was PolitiFact’s 2010 Lie of the Year . We will try to set the record straight on this particular assertion.\n",
              "We asked the Romney campaign to explain exactly how the Affordable Care Act puts the government between patient and doctor. We did not hear back, and Romney did not elaborate in his original comments.\n",
              "The overarching fact about the law is that it relies on the private sector. Employers still buy private health insurance for their workers. The law doesn’t change how much doctors are paid or what services they can provide, though it does create incentives and penalties to promote better care. (One example: It penalizes hospitals if patients are re-admitted soon after being discharged.)\n",
              "It establishes a minimum benefits package for insurance plans and fosters competition among health insurance companies by creating shopping websites. These sites, called exchanges, will allow customers to pick insurance plans the same way they might buy other things online, such as refrigerators or airplane tickets.The law also gives subsidies to people of limited means so they can buy their own insurance.\n",
              "If the health care law did get between doctors and patients, you would think most doctors would complain loudly. While some do, the leading physician advocacy group, the American Medical Association, does not. On the contrary, the AMA supports the law.\n",
              "After the Supreme Court upheld the health reform act, AMA president Jeremy Lazarus issued a statement praising the decision, because the law \"will allow patients to see their doctors earlier rather than waiting for treatment until they are sicker and care is more expensive.\"\n",
              "Lazarus doesn’t see the law making life harder for doctors; he sees it making life easier. He said it \"simplifies administrative burdens, including streamlining insurance claims, so physicians and their staff can spend more time with patients and less time on paperwork.\"\n",
              "Beyond the AMA, about nine other physician advocacy groups back all or major portions of the reform law , including the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Cardiology.\n",
              "Specialists tend to be more concerned about the impact of health care reform than the primary doctors, and that chiefly centers on the Medicare program.\n",
              "The law sets up a panel to keep Medicare spending in check. The 15-member panel is called the Independent Payment Advisory Board and starting in 2020, it can recommend changes in reimbursement rates and other cost-saving measures. Health reform law opponents sometimes speak of this panel as a backdoor to rationing, but as PolitiFact has noted many times , claims about the IPAB are often exaggerated.\n",
              "The law specifically prohibits the panel from suggesting anything that leads to rationing or reductions in either benefits or eligibility. Further, Congress has the power to overrule the panel’s recommendations.\n",
              "The law’s significant changes in the health insurance market are another source of concern.\n",
              "Dr. Dick Armstrong, the chief operating officer of Docs4PatientCare , a group opposed to the law, says Washington will be able to define the best practices for treating patients. The government would enforce those guidelines through the insurance companies and require them to reimburse only that care that matches those best practices. Armstrong said this will \"shut out\" doctors who don’t follow those rules.\n",
              "\"Best practice guidelines can reduce costs,\" Armstong said. \"But guidelines become dangerous in the hands of people who tie them to money.\"\n",
              "The law is sweeping and is designed to have an effect on the quality and cost of care. But to assume that the outcomes will only be negative requires a very selective reading of federal law that overlooks many checks on federal authority.\n",
              "First, Washington has given states the authority to set the standards for insurance plans so they can respond to local conditions.\n",
              "Second, the law calls for creation of \"strategies to align public and private payers with regard to quality and patient safety efforts,\" and insurance company participation in those exchanges is part of that effort. But the law also expressly allows insurance plans to operate outside the exchanges.\n",
              "Third, the strongest federal efforts to control spending lie in the federal Medicare program, not in the private market. Within Medicare, participation in the biggest cost-saving pilot -- Accountable Care Organizations -- is voluntary. The Accountable Care Organizations are intended to bring doctors and specialists together to treat patients and include financial incentives.\n",
              "Fourth, all regulations must pass through an extensive public review process.\n",
              "We came across one opinion poll that showed doctors evenly split on the broad question of whether the health reform law is a step in the right or the wrong direction. However, the poll’s methodology raised some red flags. It reached out to about 16,000 doctors, but only about 500 responded. In that group, specialists outnumbered primary care doctors two to one. The specialists overall were much more likely to worry that reform would drive their pay down. Surgical specialists were the most likely to say that health reform was a step in the wrong direction., \" ‘What difference, at this point, does it make?' I am the guy that got under her skin and provoked that infamous response from Hillary Clinton by asking a pretty simple question, 'Why didn't you just pick up the phone and call the survivors’ (of the Benghazi attack)?\" Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, who for weeks declined to endorse Donald Trump, called for party unification on the second night of the Republican National Convention against the \"cold, calculated lying\" of Hillary Clinton.\n",
              "Johnson is one of the only vulnerable GOP senators to appear in Cleveland, and he devoted the majority of his short speech to clobbering Clinton.\n",
              "\" ‘What difference, at this point, does it make?' I am the guy that got under her skin and provoked that infamous response from Hillary Clinton by asking a pretty simple question, 'Why didn't you just pick up the phone and call the survivors’ (of the Benghazi attack)?\"  Johnson said. \"Instead of doing that, she hatched a cover-up story and repeatedly lied to the American people.\"\n",
              "Is that how their exchange unfolded?\n",
              "We found that Johnson is accurately recounting the testimony, but being selective. Clinton’s answer was longer and more nuanced.\n",
              "During a January 2013 Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Johnson did repeatedly press Clinton about not making contact with Americans in Benghazi to \"ascertain immediately that there was no protest.\" Clinton did give her exasperated answer (which has been hashtagged and criticized ).\n",
              "\"Ron's questioning from start to finish was about how a simple phone call could have led to the truth — a fact that clearly got under Secretary Clinton's skin just as he described,\" Brian Reisinger, Johnson’s spokesman, told us.\n",
              "But Johnson’s account requires some more context, as Clinton answered the senator’s question twice before her infamous comment.\n",
              "Here is a transcript of their exchange , per PolitiFact Wisconsin , with the parts Johnson highlighted in bold:\n",
              "Johnson: \"Okay, when you read the ARB (State Department Accountability Review Board), it strikes me as how certain the people were that the attacks started at 9:40 Benghazi time. When was the first time you spoke to — or have you ever spoken to — the returnees, the evacuees? Did you personally speak to those folks?\"\n",
              "Clinton: \"I‘ve spoken to one of them, but I waited until after the ARB had done its investigation because I did not want there to be anybody raising any issue that I had spoken to anyone before the ARB conducted its investigation.\"\n",
              "Johnson: \"How many people were evacuated from Libya?\"\n",
              "Clinton: \"Well, the numbers are a little bit hard to pin down because of our other friends — \"\n",
              "Johnson: \"Approximately?\"\n",
              "Clinton: \"Approximately, 25 to 30.\"\n",
              "Johnson: \"Did anybody in the State Department talk to those folks very shortly afterwards?\"\n",
              "Clinton: \"There was discussion going on afterwards, but once the investigation started, the FBI spoke to them before we spoke to them, and so other than our people in Tripoli — which, I think you’re talking about Washington, right?\"\n",
              "Johnson: \"The point I’m making is, a very simple phone call to these individuals, I think, would’ve ascertained immediately that there was no protest prior to this. This attack started at 9:40 p.m. Benghazi time, and it was an assault. I appreciate the fact that you called it an assault. But I’m going back to then-Ambassador (Susan) Rice five days later going on the Sunday shows and, what I would say, is purposefully misleading the American public. Why wasn’t that known? And again, I appreciate the fact that the transparency of this hearing, but why weren’t we transparent to that point in time?\"\n",
              "Clinton: \"Well, first of all, senator, I would say that once the assault happened, and once we got our people rescued and out, our most immediate concern was, number one, taking care of their injuries. As I said, I still have a DS (Diplomatic Security) agent at Walter Reed seriously injured — getting them into Frankfurt, Ramstein to get taken care of, the FBI going over immediately to start talking to them. We did not think it was appropriate for us to talk to them before the FBI conducted their interviews. And we did not — I think this is accurate, sir — I certainly did not know of any reports that contradicted the IC (Intelligence Community) talking points at the time that Ambassador Rice went on the TV shows. And you know I just want to say that people have accused Ambassador Rice and the administration of misleading Americans. I can say trying to be in the middle of this and understanding what was going on, nothing could be further from the truth. Was information developing? Was the situation fluid? Would we reach conclusions later that weren’t reached initially? And I appreciate the — \"\n",
              "Johnson: \"But, Madame Secretary, do you disagree with me that a simple phone call to those evacuees to determine what happened wouldn’t have ascertained immediately that there was no protest? That was a piece of information that could have been easily, easily obtained?\"\n",
              "Clinton: \"But, senator, again — \"\n",
              "Johnson: \"Within hours, if not days?\"\n",
              "Clinton: \"Senator, you know, when you’re in these positions, the last thing you want to do is interfere with any other process going on, number one — \"\n",
              "Johnson: \"I realize that’s a good excuse.\"\n",
              "Clinton: \"Well, no, it’s the fact. Number two, I would recommend highly you read both what the ARB said about it and the classified ARB because, even today, there are questions being raised. Now, we have no doubt they were terrorists, they were militants, they attacked us, they killed our people. But what was going on and why they were doing what they were doing is still unknown —\"\n",
              "Johnson: \"No, again, we were misled that there were supposedly protests and that something sprang out of that — an assault sprang out of that — and that was easily ascertained that that was not the fact, and the American people could have known that within days and they didn’t know that.\"\n",
              "Clinton: \"With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they’d they go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, senator. Now, honestly, I will do my best to answer your questions about this, but the fact is that people were trying in real time to get to the best information. The IC has a process, I understand, going with the other committees to explain how these talking points came out. But you know, to be clear, it is, from my perspective, less important today looking backwards as to why these militants decided they did it than to find them and bring them to justice, and then maybe we’ll figure out what was going on in the meantime.\"\n",
              "Johnson: \"Okay. Thank you, Madame Secretary.\"\n",
              "So the transcript makes a few points fairly clear:\n",
              "Johnson was the guy who got Clinton riled up by asking why she didn’t call Benghazi survivors;\n",
              "Clinton did say \"What difference at this point does it make?\" in response to that question.\n",
              "But Clinton also did provide Johnson other answers. She said her priority was figuring out how to rescue those still at the compound and how to treat their injuries, not pressing them for information. She said it wasn’t appropriate for the State Department to talk to them before FBI interviews. Finally, she said her department and the administration were still trying to sort out the confusion in the days following the attacks., \" … if the Agreement goes into effect, the millions of Mexican citizens who will become eligible for Social Security benefits may have a far stronger claim to benefits and protection against cuts than U.S. citizens!\" Despite the time of year or political season, the topic of Social Security is always at the forefront of discussion, specifically among seniors tracking the status of the program and of their benefits.\n",
              "In 2021, interest from investments will stop covering the cost of the program, which provides benefits for 55 million people. The fund is projected to run out of money by 2033 – three years earlier than predicted last year, according to the federal Social Security Administration’s 2012 report . Various options have been bandied about in Washington to keep the program afloat longer, including cutting benefits and removing income tax caps to funnel more money into the system.\n",
              "The Senior Citizens League, an Alexandria, Va.-based, nonprofit advocacy group for seniors on issues including Social Security, Medicare and veteran and military retiree benefits, seized on the Social Security debate in a September mailer to members. A reader sent PolitiFact the mailer and asked us to examine the claims made by the organization.\n",
              "TSCL’s latest mailer warned about international Social Security agreements, called totalization agreements, that coordinate the U.S. Social Security program with comparable programs of other countries. The totalization agreements prevent workers in one country from paying dual national retirement system taxes when working in another country, and the pacts also help fill gaps in benefit protection for workers who have divided their careers between the United States and another country.\n",
              "The U.S. has these types of agreements with about two dozen countries. A pending agreement with Mexico was signed in 2004 but has not yet been adopted[this is repeated later]. TSCL says it retained a law firm to study the U.S./Mexico agreement and, \"They believe if the Agreement goes into effect, the millions of Mexican citizens who will become eligible for Social Security benefits may have a far stronger claim to benefits and protection against cuts than U.S. citizens!\" as reported in the mailer.\n",
              "TSCL has 1.3 million members/supporters, according to its website. The organization has been criticized in the past for its \"scare tactics\" aimed at seniors and about issues involving Social Security and health care, and for seeking donations from its members in misleading solicitations.\n",
              "We asked Shannon Benton, TSCL’s executive director, about the Social Security letter and the research done on the totalization issue. Benton says the group has worked on the issue for years, including sending out various mailers about the Mexican agreement in the past.\n",
              "TSCL hired Virginia law firm William J. Olson, P.C. to do the work over the years. The firm handles constitutional law and has done work on behalf of other organizations including Gun Owners of America and the Conservative Legal Defense and Education Fund. It has filed eight Freedom of Information Act requests between the Social Security Administration and the State Department and filed a lawsuit to obtain a copy of the agreement in December 2006, attorney Bill Olson told us in an email.\n",
              "One of TSCL’s main concerns with the Mexican agreement has been whether millions of  immigrants who have worked in this country illegally would become eligible for U.S. Social Security benefits, along with their dependents, and hurt the program’s trust funds, Olson wrote.\n",
              "Previous PolitiFact checks found that there were no plans in Congress to allow illegal immigrants to collect Social Security benefits, even though many pay in the system. They could receive benefits only when and if they became legal.\n",
              "But would Mexican citizens working in the country legally have greater protection from future cuts than U.S. citizens?\n",
              "To break down the issue, we started at the beginning. The totalization agreement with Mexico has not yet been adopted by both countries, and there are no ongoing negotiations, according to a spokeswoman for the Social Security Administration.\n",
              "We asked the administration for the number of workers who would be covered by the agreement with Mexico, but received no response. Barbara Neuby, a political science professor at Kennesaw State University who has been researching world pension changes, estimated the possible number of Mexicans covered under this agreement at around 1 million.\n",
              "Those are \"people who have paid into this [Social Security] system, those who are here [in the United States] legally,\" Neuby said.\n",
              "Social Security benefits are not a contractual right and can be changed by Congress, a 1960 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Fleming v. Nestor , established. But the TSCL claim that the totalization agreement would give Mexican citizens stronger claims to benefits and protections against cuts doesn’t hold up, according to experts on the issue.\n",
              "The agreement is based on U.S. law, and that covers every beneficiary, Neuby said. For citizens of Mexico to be treated differently than U.S. citizens, Congress would have to create an exclusion for them, she said, a move that would be \"political suicide.\"\n",
              "\"If Congress cut the U.S. benefits and not the Mexican citizens’ benefits, the people in Congress would be chased and would probably be shot,\" Neuby said, adding that such a move would be \"political suicide\" for Congress members.\n",
              "Added Gary Burtless, a senior fellow of economic studies at the Brookings Institution: It’s hard to see how the description of totalization agreements \"can be squared with the idea that foreign citizens who receive Social Security would be exempt from a legislated cut in Social Security benefits that applies to U.S. citizens.\"\n",
              "While it is true that Congress can cut Social Security benefits, the claim that the pending totalization agreement would better protect Mexican citizens from benefits cuts is not accurate. The pending agreement has not been approved by the United States or Mexico, but to exclude some citizens from any cuts would require an exemption by Congress that is highly unlikely., \"#Broward elections department has a history of violating the law.\" As Florida headed toward multiple recounts, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., went on a Twitter tear directed at Broward Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes.\n",
              "Rubio took aim at the supervisor in one of Florida’s blue bastions as the county was still tabulating ballots more than 40 hours after the polls closed. Big races for U.S. Senate, governor and state agriculture commissioner hung in the balance.\n",

              "Hours later, there was yet another lawsuit filed against Snipes, this time from Gov. Rick Scott, the Republican U.S. Senate candidate. A Broward judge ruled in Scott’s favor and found Snipes was in violation of Florida public records laws for not fulfilling a record’s request by Scott’s campaign.\n",

              "The lawsuits that Rubio cited were filed in 2017. Snipes lost both lawsuits and has appealed them.\n",
              "One lawsuit was filed by Tim Canova after he lost a Democratic primary to U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz in 2016. Canova, concerned about the integrity of the election, wanted to inspect the paper ballots after he lost. He said she refused to comply, and he sued.\n",
              "Snipes testified that her office had destroyed the ballots after she signed an order Sept. 1, 2017 to authorize destruction of boxes. But under federal law, ballots are supposed to be preserved for 22 months.\n",
              "Broward Judge Raag Singhal ruled in May against Snipes, finding \"premature destruction of the records unlawful and in violation of the Public Records Act.\"\n",
              "Following the ruling, the state announced it would send election experts to monitor her office.\n",
              "The other lawsuit was filed by the Republican Party of Florida in 2017 and pertained to Snipes’ procedures for opening mail-in ballots. GOP poll watchers said in 2016 her office opened mail in ballots in private.\n",
              "In August before the 2018 primary, Singhal issued a declaratory injunction that prevented Snipes from opening the ballots before the county’s Canvassing Board met.\n",
              "However, Singhal wrote that the lawsuit pertained to handling of ballots in future elections, and not whether Snipes violated state law in past elections.\n",

So how does that compare to the 2011 January-through-June figure that inspired the tweet?\n",

              "While the filings figures offer trend line, they tell us very little about the nature of the businesses, leaving to speculation whether they represent signs of real new businesses, future businesses, or just paperwork signaling legal and tax changes.\n",
              "Also, it’s impossible to calculate the number of new businesses without knowing what is happening to existing businesses. If, for instance, new filings increased by 5,000 but 6,000 businesses failed, the uptick in filings, by itself, would create a misleading sign of growth.\n",

              "To make up for the subsidies, MU announced it would give a one-time fellowship to all eligible graduate student s. By law, the university couldn’t tell students the fellowships funds had to be used to purchase health insurance.\n",
              "On Aug. 21, after significant student pressure , MU announced it would \"defer implementation of its decision regarding graduate student health insurance,\" according to a letter by MU Chancellor R. Bowen Loftin . In other words, the university reinstated graduate student health insurance subsidies — at least for the time being.\n",
              "Even after the university restored the subsidies, it wasn’t clear if MU’s initial withdrawal of the funds could be blamed on the Affordable Care Act, or if MU had actually broken the law by reinstating the benefits. We decided to take a look.\n",

              "MU student employees aren’t eligible for the group health plan the university offers to other workers. And, unlike other universities, MU doesn’t provide a student group health insurance plan.\n",
              "Instead, students — graduate and undergraduate — can opt to sign up for an individual health plan offered through Aetna Health.\n",
              "Some graduate students are eligible to receive subsidies from MU to pay for their insurance, according to the MU Office of Graduate Studies website. To get the money, graduate students have to sign up for a student individual health plan provided by Aetna.\n",
              "Then, students must email the Office of Graduate Studies, which verifies enrollment in the plan and eligibility for subsidies. Students then receive a reimbursement for the insurance plan’s partial or total cost. Subsidy levels depend on, among other factors, the number of hours students work per week.\n",
              "By asking students to enroll in an individual health plan to receive money, MU requires its student employees to use the subsidies to purchase insurance, said Sidney Watson, a health law professor at St. Louis University School of Law.\n",
              "That’s a big no-no, according to IRS regulations created to enforce the Affordable Care Act. According to the IRS, employers are allowed to give money to their employees that could go toward purchasing individual health insurance. But employers can’t require workers to use the cash specifically for that purpose, Watson said.\n",
              "To comply with the health care law, employers can provide subsidies — and require that the money be used to purchase health insurance — only to employees enrolled in a group plans.\n",

              "Technically speaking, MU’s withdrawal of health insurance subsidies for graduate students is \"the result of the interpretation of the Affordable Care Act by the Treasury Department, because the Affordable Care Act itself doesn’t address this question,\" said Timothy Jost, a professor of health care law at Washington and Lee University.\n",
              "So, it’s not just the Affordable Care Act that caused the problem. But, the idea that the removal of benefits is a \"direct result of\" the Affordable Care Act isn’t too far from reality.\n",
              "Absent the Affordable Care Act, Jost said, it’s likely MU would still be able to legally provide subsidies for graduate students to purchase individual health plans.\n",

              "MU could dodge legal trouble by adopting UCLA’s model, Kominski said. Health insurance is a mandatory for all UCLA students and it’s a condition of enrollment, according to the university’s website. UCLA automatically signs up all students in a student group health plan, which they’re all then billed for.  This effectively requires all graduate students who’ve received increased stipends to use the money to pay for insurance unless they can prove they have insurance from another source, Kominski said.\n",
              "Jost, the Washington and Lee law professor, came up with another alternative.\n",

              "Abrams has been a fixture in Republican foreign policy circles for decades. He was assistant Secretary of State during the Reagan administration in the 1980s, and served as a special assistant to President George. W. Bush. He is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, a prominent policy think tank based in New York City.\n",
              "A legal comparison\n",
              "Both men pleaded guilty to making false statements to Congress, but Cohen also pleaded guilty to tax evasion, filing false statements on a loan application and hiding an illegal campaign contribution . That last one involved payments to porn star Stephanie Clifford (also known as Stormy Daniels) to buy her silence in the closing weeks of Trump’s presidential campaign.\n",
              "As for lying to Congress as the tweet claims, Cohen told Senate and House committees in August and October 2017 that discussions over a Trump Moscow development project ended in January 2016, before the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. In his pleading, Cohen said that talks continued for months beyond that.\n",

              "Abrams’ offense dates to the mid-1980s. The Reagan administration was keen to stifle the leftist government that held power in the Central American nation of Nicaragua. To that end, the United States funded the Contras, an armed insurgency that battled for control of Nicaraguan territory.\n",
              "Congress objected, and in 1982, it banned support for the Contras. The Reagan administration carried on through a covert operation that sold arms to Iran, itself subject to an embargo, and used the proceeds to buy weapons the Contras needed.\n",
              "Abrams supplemented that cash with a $10 million contribution from the sultan of Brunei. Abrams gave the sultan’s representative a Swiss bank account number to complete the transaction.\n",
              "The crash of a small plane helping supply the Contras exposed the operation. Congress investigated. When asked by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence if any foreign government had helped supply the Contras, Abrams said, \"No.\"\n",
              "Abrams pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts of lying to Congress on the matter. He was later pardoned by President George H.W. Bush.\n",
              "In comparing the two, John Q. Barrett, a law professor at St. John’s University who helped prosecute the Iran-Contra investigation, said, \"Both Abrams and Cohen pleaded guilty and cooperated with law enforcement.\"\n",
              "He added, \"Convicted criminals provide truthful and valuable information to government, both law enforcement and legislative oversight, all the time.\"\n",
              "The turmoil in Venezuela, with two men claiming to be the country’s rightful leader, widespread protests and economic collapse, brought Abrams back before a congressional committee recently in his role as the administration's Special Representative, a diplomatic post. Omar attacked him (her own word), saying, \"I fail to understand why members of this committee or the American people should find any testimony that you give today to be truthful.\"\n",
              "Right now, the main difference vis-à-vis false congressional testimony, is that Abrams has been pardoned and Cohen has not. That gives more support for challenging Cohen’s testimony, said Harvard law professor Alex Whiting. But Whiting cautioned that such distinctions are subjective.\n",
              "\"When it comes to convictions for perjury, it is often the case that how one feels about the seriousness of the crime and conviction depends on what one thinks of the person,\" Whiting said.\n",

              "Labels aside, there is credible and corroborated reporting that the Contras killed unarmed men, women and children, committed rape and torture , attacked civilian facilities, such as hospitals and food warehouses, and conducted mass kidnappings. While not all Contra groups were human rights violators, some acted with extreme brutality., \"$1 billion—that’s how much Bruce Rauner has wasted with his budget crisis.\" Big, round numbers play well in politics and this election year, \"$1 billion\" is having its moment in the race for Illinois governor.\n",
              "First there was Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner proclaiming in a commercial that the budget he proposed earlier this year contained a $1 billion tax break for Illinoisans. We rated the same claim Mostly False after he unveiled his budget plan in February.\n",
              "Now, Rauner’s fall challenger, Democrat J.B. Pritzker, is out with an ad skewering the incumbent for squandering the same amount in taxpayer dollars.\n",
              "\"$1 billion—that’s how much Bruce Rauner has wasted with his budget crisis,\" the ad asserts. \"Bruce Rauner poured that money down the drain.\"\n",
              "There’s no doubt Rauner, as the state’s chief executive, played a starring role in the prolonged budget showdown with the legislature that left the state without a spending plan for two years. But he had plenty of co-stars, among them House Speaker Michael Madigan and Senate President John Cullerton, both Chicago Democrats.\n",
              "Pritzker’s attack is as short on detail as it is sharp on condemnation. Where does that $1 billion figure come from and why should Rauner own it? The ad doesn’t say, so we decided to take a look.\n",
              "Adding it all up\n",
              "The answer to the first question is simple. A spokesman for the Pritzker campaign said the number comes from Democratic State Comptroller Susana Mendoza, the keeper of the state’s books and a frequent Rauner critic.\n",
              "Mendoza calculated that the state racked up $1.03 billion in late payment penalties in 2017, largely because the budget standoff led to major delays in paying state vendors for their services.\n",
              "The budget impasse dragged on because the governor and Democrats who run the legislature had very different policy, tax and spending priorities. As a lawyer might put it, there was plenty of contributory negligence—not to mention gamesmanship and plain old stubborness—to go around.\n",
              "In short, the budget became hostage to an ideological debate centered on so-called Turnaround Agenda demands from Rauner that Democrats argued were largely unrelated to a state spending plan. In dispute were issues that included the imposition of term limits for legislators, a freeze on local property taxes, and workers’ compensation cuts.\n",
              "Also fueling the budget crisis and the bill backlog that grew with it was a significant drop in revenue after a temporary state income tax increase expired, reducing the rate from 5 percent to 3.75 percent just days before Rauner was sworn into office in 2015.\n",
              "Rauner had pressed the legislature to let it lapse, and Madigan and Cullerton obliged over the objections of then Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn, who lost to the Republican in November 2014. State law mandated the rate reduction at the end of that year, but Quinn urged lawmakers to step in and prevent it.\n",
              "\"I warned there would be dire catastrophe in my budget address and I laid out what the catastrophe could look like in an attempt to try and get the legislature to extend it, but no Republicans came forward and many Democrats were leery before November's election,\" Quinn told us in a phone interview. \"They simply did not want to vote on revenue before November—Democrats and Republicans.\"\n",
              "It’s also worth noting that, even before the 2014 tax cut, the state had been accruing large penalties for tardy bill payments. A report from the Civic Federation, a Chicago-based budget watchdog, shows late payment interest penalties totaled more than $600 million in the three years prior to the budget standoff.\n",
              "David Merriman, an economist who heads the Fiscal Futures Project at the University of Illinois, sees the penalties as evidence of the state’s legacy of poor fiscal management, with government leaders of both parties approving budgets for nearly two decades that balanced out only on paper.\n",
              "\"The fiscal situation has been unsustainable, [Rauner] inherited it, it got worse under Rauner because they didn't have a budget for two years and because he didn't control spending,\" Merriman said. \"That’s his fault, but it’s also the legislature's fault.\"\n",
              "Eventually, after two years of operating on autopilot and jeopardizing a number of critical services in the process, lawmakers last summer did put a budget in place that included an income tax rate hike, which provided a big jump in revenue. Rauner had vetoed that plan, but a handful of Republicans joined Democrats to override his rejection., \"$1.8 billion Of Soros’ money just intercepted – he could officially go to prison for years\" Billionaire George Soros has made his final donation, according to some conservative bloggers.\n",

This claim refers to two projects in St. Joseph, Mo., that were awarded Community Development Block Grants by the city, with funds from the stimulus. The martini bar owner, who had been awarded $25,000 to expand his existing business, withdrew his application for the federal funds on Jan. 21, 2010, after it was discovered that the company had liens placed against it by the IRS and the state for failing to pay a little more than $8,000 in taxes, said St. Joseph's Community Development Manager Gerald McCush.\n",
              "\"You get no funds from  the stimulus if you owe the IRS money, sorry,\" McCush said.\n",
              "So, the martini bar is  getting no stimulus.\n",
              "As for the steakhouse, a city committee awarded $75,000 in Community Development Block Grant recovery money to ECBG LLC, a private company, to build a Brazilian steakhouse downtown.\n",
              "\"We are trying to revitalize the downtown,\" McCush explained. \"That is a priority for the City Council. We have a pretty blighted downtown.\"\n",
              "In all, the city received $475,000 worth of Community Development Block Grant funds from the stimulus. A city committee that included two City Council members, two representatives of the Chamber of Commerce, a city planner and some other city residents decided on the projects from among $2 million worth of requests.\n",
              "The steakhouse was selected not only because it met the city's priority for revitalizing the downtown, McCush said, but also because it would result in a number of new jobs. The steakhouse will anchor a downtown building that includes several other retail spaces. Construction of the building employed roughly 60 construction workers, McCush said, and the restaurant is expected to employ 30 people full time.\n",
              "The restaurant is scheduled to open in April.\n",
              "McConnell is largely on target with his claim about the projects and the money they were awarded in stimulus funds. The application for money related to the martini bar has since been withdrawn, though it did initially receive the award., \"$120,000 will be spent by taxpayers on Charlie Crist's political photo-op special session.\" On July 8, 2010, Gov. Charlie Crist called for a special session July 20-23 for legislators to put a constitutional amendment on the November ballot to ban oil drilling near Florida's coasts.\n",
              "Republican Marco Rubio, one of independent Crist's rival in the U.S. Senate race, immediately accused Crist of using the session for political gain.\n",
              "Rubio wrote in a July 9 press release , \"$120,000 will be spent by taxpayers on Charlie Crist's political photo-op special session.\"\n",
              "Clearly, Crist will get news coverage including photo-ops out of the special session -- as will legislative leaders from both parties. But does Rubio have the dollar figure right?\n",
              "Everyone we spoke to agrees it's hard to say, but $40,000 a day is the most common figure used. When Crist announced this session, The Palm Beach Post  cited a $40,000 a day figure while the  St. Petersburg Times  wrote $50,000. Other articles simply stated \"tens of thousands a day.\"\n",
              "In the archives, we found that the $40,000 figure has been quoted for decades -- as early as 1983 in the Miami Herald and 1989 in the St. Petersburg Times. Is there no such thing as inflation when it comes to special sessions in Florida?\n",
              "We asked the House and Senate for the bills from some recent special sessions , and we added up the average costs for both legislative bodies to get one average cost per day. The special session in early October 2007 on budget cuts and personal injury protection for motorists cost an average of $47,924.19 per day. Another session later in October 2007 (property tax cuts) cost an average of $45,329.64. A session in January 2009 (state budget) cost an average of $46,378.71 per day. The average for those three sessions was about $46,544 per day.\n",
              "Then is $46,544 a good daily average? Not necessarily. The House and Senate spokespersons, the Division of Management Services and the Office for Legislative Services all caution that those averages are imprecise. For example, they include just travel, meals, hotels and per diem. Jill Chamberlin, spokesperson for the House, says the per-diem for special sessions is $80 a day. However, lawmakers can get reimbursements instead: up to $110 a day for hotel, up to $36 a day for meals, and travel at 44.5 cents per mile or the common airline fare. The OLS calculates the length of the session differently for each body depending on what they scheduled on their calendars each day.\n",
              "The averages also don't include the cost of aides. If legislators want to bring an aide -- most don't for a brief special session -- that is paid for out of their district funds, which are also taxpayer dollars. Lawmakers may come into Tallahassee the day before the session or stay overnight when it ends, which affect the costs.\n",
              "Chamberlin also notes that some special sessions include committee meetings instead of floor sessions that require full attendance, so the bean-counters try to separate those costs from the special-session costs. For example, a December 2009 session on transportation was mostly committee meetings so expenses associated with the session were low: an average of $22,105.31.\n",
              "We contacted the Florida Department of Management Services to ask about electricity use and other routine building costs. Do they contribute to the cost of a special session? Not really, says Linda McDonald, DMS spokeswoman, in an e-mail. She explains that the lights and the staff are there year-round. The electric bill was higher in January 2009 for the special session on the budget than in January 2008, but McDonald blames higher rates, not the special session, for most of the increase.\n",
              "There probably will be minimal additional costs for the Capitol Police, but Florida Department of Law Enforcement spokesman Mike Morrison said he couldn't speculate on the amount. The police provide security to the complex year round.\n",
              "Pinpointing the average is not a simple task because there are so many variables, said Lisa Swindle, finance and accounting director for the Office of Legislative Services. But each time the OLS attempts to come up with an average, it is around $40,000, she said. Swindle said several years ago both the House and Senate appropriation bills allotted an additional $40,000 per day for each body for special sessions if they needed it, and that's likely why it's the most common figure used. She also says the one coming up will be \"a true special session,\" without deducting cost of committee meetings, so we here at PolitiFact will update those costs when the session is over.\n",
              "We asked for cost records of special sessions in the 1980s and 1990s to see why the $40,000 figure has stood up for so long. But the OLS says it doesn't have those records.\n",
              "We asked Rubio's campaign where it got the $120,000 figure. Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos said the campaign had heard reports between $30,000 and $50,000 a day, and he cited a July 9 blog in the  Orlando Sentinel . Even that blog states that Rubio's $120,000 figure \"is probably low.\"\n",
              "So where does that leave us?\n",
              "When Crist announced the special session, Rubio pounced and accused him of creating a $120,000-taxpayer funded photo op for a four-day special session. Rubio was being conservative with his numbers, using the low-end of $30,000 for four days. We're going with actual average of $46,544 from three recent sessions, and adding a fudge factor for all those imprecise costs that nobody in Tallahassee seems able to pin down. Let's call it a minimum of $50,000 a day, and $200,000 if this session lasts four days., \"$16 trillion (the national debt) in $1 bills would cover the entire state of Ohio nearly 1.5 times.\" The U.S. government has carried debt since 1790, according to the Treasury Department, but the national debt didn't top $1 trillion until 1982.\n",
              "When it hit $16 trillion for the first time on Sept. 4, 2012, Sen. Rob Portman called it \"a dangerous milestone\" and \"troubling evidence that our nation is headed in the wrong direction.\"\n",
              "In an attempt to put $16 trillion in terms everyday people can get their arms around, he also released a list of items showing how that much money stacks up -- such as \"$16 trillion in $1 bills would cover the entire state of Ohio nearly 1.5 times.\"\n",

              "The area in square footage equals 63,870 square miles (after you divide by 5,280 squared, or 27,878,400).\n",

Sixteen trillion singles would cover that area almost exactly 1.5 times., \"$2.4 million of the NIH dollars was spent on ‘origami’ condoms.\" During a recent visit to Virginia, U.S. Sen. Rand Paul took exception to claims that budget cuts have hurt the National Institute of Health’s efforts to find a cure for Ebola.\n",

              "Origami is the Japanese art of folding paper to form animals, flowers and other designs, according to Webster’s New World College Dictionary. We struggled to imagine how this centuries-old craft might improve the condom.\n",
              "Paul’s office backed the senator’s statement by sending us several articles about NIH’s funding of condom research, the earliest one published by the Washington Free Beacon this March.\n",
              "Turns out, there’s a California company, named ORIGAMI , that’s vowing to reinvent the condom, a contraceptive that many men don’t like. The company believes the popularity of condoms  -- which must be unrolled and are typically made of latex -- would greatly improve if they were more pleasing, less cumbersome and safer to use.\n",
              "ORIGAMI is developing condom with accordion-like pleats. They’re made of silicone and, because they’re loose-fitting and don’t have to be unrolled, can be put on faster than traditional condoms. The company is seeking FDA approval and hopes sell its product next year.\n",
              "A number of global health organizations are encouraging condom research and development, convinced that greater use of devices will lead to fewer unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases such as AIDs.\n",
              "Since 2006, NIH has awarded seven grants totaling almost $2.5 million to help develop male and female ORIGAMI condoms. The money was provided to Strata Various, a product design firm headed by Danny Resnic, ORIGAMI’s founder. Resnic is listed on the grant documents as the project leader of the research.\n",
              "ORIGAMI’s work has been praised by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which last year handed out $1.1 million in grants other entrepreneurs seeking to improve condoms. The Foundation said ORIGAMI \"provides an excellent example of a private enterprise focused on new condom design to promote consistent use by emphasizing the sexual experience.\"\n",
              "Now, let’s return to Paul’s speech. The senator, in lamenting the use of public funds to develop  \"origami’ condoms,\" never defined the difference between the folded paper art and the name of a company.\n",
              "We asked Brian Darling, a spokesman for Paul, whether his boss was referring to Origami with a capital \"O,\" meaning the company, or a small \"o,\" meaning the art form. \"The senator’s words speak for themselves,\" Darling replied in an email. \"I don’t understand the confusion.\"\n",
              "The day before he appeared in Ashland, Paul spelled origami with a small \"o\" in Facebook post and a tweet assailing NIH’s spending.\n",

Medicare for All costs ~$32T. That means 66% of Medicare for All could have been funded already by the Pentagon.\" Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is one of Congress’ most ardent supporters of Medicare for All, the Democratic proposal to expand Medicare to all ages in order to create a government-funded health insurance system for all Americans.\n",
              "In a tweet , Ocasio-Cortez compared the scale of Pentagon waste to the price tag for Medicare for All, which a study by the free-market Mercatus Institute said would cost $32 trillion over 10 years . This fact-check will focus on her point about Pentagon spending. It is important to note that the $32 trillion Medicare figure she cited is based on one group’s estimate using assumptions about how the proposal would affect current rates of spending; it is not an official cost figure.\n",
              "On Dec. 2, 2018, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted a screenshot from an article in the Nation, a left-leaning magazine, along with the following comment:\n",
              "\"$21 TRILLION of Pentagon financial transactions ‘could not be traced, documented, or explained.’ $21T in Pentagon accounting errors. Medicare for All costs ~$32T. That means 66% of Medicare for All could have been funded already by the Pentagon. And that’s before our premiums.\"\n",
              "Observers quickly pounced on the tweet, saying that Ocasio-Cortez was misreading the Nation article. So we took a closer look.\n",
              "Misreading the source material\n",
              "The Nov. 27 Nation article addressed a historical pattern of accounting discrepancies at the Pentagon.\n",
              "The portion that Ocasio-Cortez highlighted in her tweet referenced research by Mark Skidmore, a professor of economics at Michigan State University. Citing Skidmore’s research, the story said \"in all, at least a mind-boggling $21 trillion of Pentagon financial transactions between 1998 and 2015 could not be traced, documented, or explained.\"\n",
              "The problem with what Ocasio-Cortez said: The $21 trillion figure refers to a cumulative amount of individual transactions — including some double- and triple-counting — not a single pot of money that was misspent.\n",
              "One tip-off is the amount of Ocasio-Cortez’s \"accounting errors\" is far bigger than the actual Pentagon spending from 1998 to 2015, which was $8.5 trillion. In fact, it’s also far bigger than the amount the government has spent on national security since 1940 and, in all likelihood, in the nation’s history.\n",
              "Here’s a chart we assembled showing national-security spending by the federal government from 1940 to today. Ocasio-Cortez’s $21 trillion estimate exceeds the entirety of national-security spending since 1940 , which checks in around $17.8 trillion. And while full data back to 1776 doesn’t exist, prorating backwards for another 164 years would almost certainly not add enough to make the total $21 trillion.\n",
              "Ocasio-Cortez’s mistake\n",
              "So what did Ocasio-Cortez get wrong?\n",
              "The $21 trillion figure tallies up internal financial transfers that would not pass muster in an audit; the same dollar can be included in multiple transactions, which is why Ocasio-Cortez’s figure exceeds all Pentagon spending.\n",
              "This misunderstanding renders the Medicare for All comparison inaccurate, experts said.\n",
              "Although he’s a longstanding critic of Pentagon waste, Steve Ellis, the vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said Ocasio-Cortez had dramatically inflated the scale of the problem.\n",
              "\"One dollar involved in 10 transactions is not 10 dollars,\" Ellis said. \"There is a lot to cut and a lot of waste at the Pentagon, and I have unapologetically said so. But simple math demonstrates that the Pentagon did not get anywhere near that amount of cash, averaging more than $1 trillion per year, much less lost track of anywhere near that amount of money.\"\n",
              "Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, agreed.\n",
              "The $21 trillion figure \"double- and triple-counts funding that was transferred internally within the Defense Department,\" Harrison said. \"And just because a transaction cannot be fully traced and documented does not mean it was fraudulent or wasted. It just means the Pentagon has not been able to pass an audit, which we already knew.\"\n",
              "Just to be sure, we checked with the author of the Nation article, Dave Lindorff.\n",
              "\"She's wrong,\" he said.\n",
              "Lindorff said his findings suggest large-scale sloppiness in accounting and potentially deliberate obfuscation to deter congressional oversight — but not a fixed budgetary amount that could have theoretically been applied to other uses.\n",
              "While some of the $21 trillion may be real expenditures, Lindorff said, \"clearly most of it is simply fictitious numbers designed to obfuscate the accounting and keep the Pentagon accounting from being seriously monitored. It would be wrong to suggest that that is real money that could have been used to fund something else more useful to society.\"\n",
              "It's also worth noting that the Nation article and the Mercatus study refer to different time periods, said Ben Tomchik, deputy chief of staff at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The Nation's figure refers to 18 years — twice as long as the Mercatus study's 10-year period.\n",
              "Ocasio-Cortez’s office did not respond to an inquiry.

That includes a bill that just passed the last day of this session -- a bad day for public education, folks -- $3 billion over the next five years will be taken out of our public schools and be put into vouchers,\" Rich said on May 10 in remarks to the Orange County Voters League. ( Rejoice Magazine  posted video of her remarks online.)\n",

Regardless of the specifics, opponents say it sends funding to private -- mostly religious -- schools and undermines the public school system. Supporters say that the money provides poor children, including many minorities, a deserved escape from underperforming public schools.\n",
              "Here’s how it works: In 2001 under Gov. Jeb Bush, the state established the Florida Tax Credit Scholarship Program to give scholarships to poor children to attend private schools. The program provides dollar-for-dollar income tax credits for corporations that give money to organizations that give the scholarships. (Both Scott and Crist , the Democratic primary frontrunner, are supporters of the program.)\n",
              "About 60,000 students have scholarships for the 2013-14 school year, and the maximum amount per student is $4,880.\n",
              "During the session, Republican lawmakers proposed allowing more children to get the scholarships. A watered-down version of the bill, Senate 850, passed on May 2, the last day of session. (It passed the Senate 29-11 and the House 70-44, largely along party lines with many Democrats voting against it.)\n",
              "Lawmakers expanded eligibility by allowing a family of four earning up to $62,010 a year to receive a partial scholarship. The previous limit was about $44,000.\n",
              "Scott has until June 28, 2014, to sign the law. A spokesman for Scott wouldn’t indicate if he will sign it, but Scott has generally been supportive of school choice.\n",
              "Do tax credits take money out of public schools?\n",
              "Rich arrived at the $3 billion figure by pointing to a chart from Fund Education Now , a group that opposes the tax credits.\n",
              "The chart shows that before this session, the tax credit program was on a path to add up to about $2.9 billion over the next five years. Though the chart doesn’t reflect the bill that ultimately passed, the program could add up to that amount over five years.\n",
              "But does that money get taken out of our public schools, as Rich suggests?\n",
              "Rich and other tax credit opponents argue that if Florida had no such tax credit program, those revenues would go into the state’s general fund, which pays for education and other services.\n",
              "\"It’s money that could be, should be, by all rights put into the general fund and could be used to invest in public schools,\" said Kathleen Oropeza, co-founder of Fund Education Now. \"They are diverting it.\"\n",
              "Not so, say supporters of tax credits -- for two reasons:\n",
              "• If the tax credit program didn’t exist, the money would go toward state general revenues. There is no evidence that the Legislature would then decide to direct those dollars to public schools.\n",
              "(State economist Amy Baker backs up that point in an email to PolitiFact Florida: \"These numbers refer only to the revenue side of the state’s fiscal picture and don’t reflect what the Legislature may or may not spend\" for public schools.)\n",
              "• Tax credits can save the state money because a single voucher is less expensive than what the state spends per child in public schools.\n",
              "\"State education spending for students who receive scholarships is reduced by more than the amount of revenue lost,\" states a 2008 study by Florida’s Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability.\n",
              "The study noted that it is difficult to pinpoint the precise savings but estimated that in 2007-08, for every dollar lost in corporate income tax revenue, taxpayers saved $1.49 in state education funding. A later update estimated that the state saved about $36 million in 2008-09.\n",
              "We sent a summary of the arguments to two education professors who are experts on tax credits: David Figlio at Northwestern University and Kevin Welner at the University of Colorado.\n",
              "Both said it’s not as simple as Rich declared.\n",
              "\"The answer to this is a little bit complicated. It is definitely true that, overall, taxpayers save money with this program, at least under the scenario that has been operating to date. The tax credits that the state provides are considerably smaller per student than the public obligation would be to these students were they attending public schools,\" Figlio told PolitiFact Florida.\n",
              "However, it’s hard to pinpoint the amount of savings because some students would have attended private schools anyway.\n",
              "Now that the raised the income eligibility limits opens up the program to more families, it’s likely that more will get scholarships that would have found a way to pay for private school regardless.\n",
              "Welner told PolitiFact Florida that \"there clearly is an attempt here to shift resources from public to private schools.\" However, the $3 billion figure is just half the ledger., \"$360 million of our tax dollars went straight to ... the Taliban.\" Democratic ex-congressman Alan Grayson is talking about the Taliban again.\n",
              "The first time -- when he not-so-subtly compared his opponent in the 2010 election to the Taliban -- didn't work so well. See, previous paragraph (i.e., ex ).\n",

The bipartisan commission determined the U.S. government lost between $31 billion and $60 billion to waste and fraud as a result of ineffective oversight of contract spending.\n",
              "Grayson elaborated in his e-mail: \"In fact, $360 million of our tax dollars went straight to ... the Taliban. Wow. Who could have imagined that? Well ... me.\"\n",

He wrote that he voted against the wars, was a vocal opponent of them while in office and provided breakdowns of the war's toll on taxpayers.\n",
              "His point? He did something against the wars.\n",

              "It didn't take long to turn up what he was talking about.\n",
              "Grayson was referencing an Aug. 16, 2011, story by the Associated Press that preceded the commission's in-depth report. The AP reported that an investigation by a military task force found that $360 million in taxpayer money meant to strengthen Afghanistan's economy ended up going to \"the Taliban, criminals and power brokers with ties to both.\"\n",
              "It happened through a process called \"reverse money laundering.\" The AP explained it like this: American money starts out clean as it is given to companies hired by the military for transportation, construction, fuel and other projects. But the funds become \"tainted\" -- landing in the hands of crime groups and the Taliban -- either by direct payments or through the network of subcontractors.\n",
              "The Taliban and insurgent groups only reaped a \"small percentage\" of this $360 million, an anonymous Kabul-based military official told the AP. Most of the money was lost to profiteering, bribery and extortion by criminals and power brokers.\n",
              "About half of the lost money stemmed from a large transportation contract called Host Nation Trucking, comprised of eight prime companies that hired nearly three dozen subcontractors to transport supplies to U.S. troops in Afghan bases. Those subcontractors then paid off insurgents or warlords who control the roads. The task force found that one of the prime contractors, HEB International Logistics, made direct payments to \" malign actors ,\" the designation given to the network of corrupt Afghan government and business officials, criminals and insurgents.\n",
              "The work of the military task force ran \"parallel\" with the research of the wartime contracting commission, commission spokesman Clark Irwin said.  But the military's findings have not been publicly made available (at least as far as we can tell).\n",
              "The wartime contracting commission's report, however, is a publicly available document . That report does not peg a specific dollar figure on moneys lost to the Taliban and other criminal groups. It notes, however, that extortion of U.S. transportation and construction project money is the second-largest source of revenue for insurgent groups, behind the drug trade ( pages 73-4 ).\n",
              "From the report: \"In Iraq and Afghanistan, U.S. funds have been diverted to insurgents and warlords as a cost of doing business in the country. In Afghanistan, insurgents, warlords, or other groups control or contest parts of the country. They threaten to destroy projects and harm personnel. The Commission finds it particularly alarming that Afghan subcontractors on U.S.-funded convoys, road construction, and development projects pay insurgent groups for protection.\"\n",
              "We asked the member of the commission who wrote that excerpt and an expert on the issue, University of Baltimore government contracting professor Charles Tiefer, for his opinion on Grayson's statement. There was no unclassified amount for money diverted to the Taliban until recently, Tiefer said, but the $360 million figure is credible based on information he gained while on a trip to Kandahar in March and the commission's conclusions.\n",
              "\"That figure is consistent with it being the insurgent's second-largest funding source,\" he said, noting that finding a precise number would be nearly impossible.\n",
              "Tiefer went on to compliment Grayson, saying he \"was among the first lawyers to discuss publicly the scale of contracting waste in Iraq -- I never talked to him but I read what he had to say -- so, I think he has more right than most congressmen to pronounce on this issue.\"\n",
              "Grayson, reached by e-mail, said he received further information on the subject from military briefings during his time in Congress, congressional delegation trips and several whistle-blower clients who worked for contractors in Afghanistan, \"none of which, unfortunately, I am allowed to share with you, except to say that the figure is corroborated,\" he wrote.\n",
              "Here's what we know: Grayson correctly quoted a figure from a national story about U.S. money being diverted to \"the Taliban, criminals and power brokers with ties to both.\" A member of the Commission on Wartime Contracting -- and an expert in the field of government contracting -- found this information credible based on extensive research.\n",
              "But Grayson's statement comes with two minor caveats. He said that tax dollars went \"straight to ... the Taliban.\" The process is actually more complicated and involved a type of money laundering. And the money went to bad actors other than the Taliban in some cases. Those are noteworthy clarifications and enough to rate Grayson's statement Mostly True., \"$500 billion of the extension of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy goes to 120,000 families.\" Vice President Joe Biden moves into high-dudgeon mode when sharing his view that Republican budget cuts would harm average Americans.\n",
              "He was in that zone during swing-state stops after the Republican National Convention, shouting out this line of attack at a Green Bay campaign rally on Sept. 2, 2012.\n",
              "\"They didn’t tell you why they are eviscerating all these efforts to help the working and middle class people of America,\" Biden said . \"They are doing it all in the service of massive tax cuts for the very wealthy … $500 billion of the extension of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy goes to 120,000 families. Hear what I just said! One-half trillion dollars will go to 120,000 American families!\"\n",
              "Let’s examine Biden’s math and his characterization of the tax cuts enacted during Republican George W. Bush’s two-term presidency.\n",
              "The Bush tax cuts\n",
              "The Bush tax cuts , mostly in 2001 and 2003, lowered federal income tax rates at all levels, decreased the marriage penalty, lowered taxes on capital gains and dividends, boosted the child tax credit and phased out restrictions on how much higher-income people could deduct in mortgage interest and personal exemptions.\n",
              "Those cuts were set to expire in 2010, but President Barack Obama and Congress agreed to extend them until Jan. 1, 2013.\n",
              "Going forward, Obama thinks the cuts should stay in place for 98 percent of taxpayers, but wants to end them on income over $250,000 earned by couples or income over $200,000 for individuals.\n",
              "Republicans, including Romney, want to make all the cuts permanent -- and that’s what drew Biden’s ire.\n",
              "Biden’s claim\n",
              "What about Biden’s half-trillion dollar claim?\n",
              "His campaign said he based it on 10-year projections by White House budget officials , and private studies. Federal budgets typically look ahead 10 years.\n",
              "Biden took a budget projection of $968 billion in tax savings, based on the cuts expiring for the top 2 percent. Then he determined that, within that group, the top 0.1 percent includes about 120,000 families -- and got 55 percent of that $968 million in tax savings.\n",
              "The math comes out to $532 billion for those families -- the \"half trillion\" Biden shouted about.\n",
              "Biden got the 55 percent and the 120,000 figures from two studies by the independent Tax Policy Center , a project of the Brookings Institution and Urban Institute that is a primary source of detailed reports on tax plans offered by elected officials and candidates. One of the studies said those 120,000 taxpayers have an average annual income of $8.4 million.\n",
              "The vice president’s methodology got a thumbs down from Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, but a thumbs up from Andrew Fieldhouse, the federal budget policy analyst at the Economic Policy Institute , a liberal think tank.\n",
              "We asked both -- and a third expert, from the business-backed Tax Foundation -- to take their own look at the slice of tax benefits for 120,000 families at the top of the income range. And the Romney campaign offered up its own figures.\n",
              "Here’s what we learned:\n",
              "-- Williams did a back-of-the-envelope calculation based on Tax Policy Center data and estimated the 120,000 families would save more than $400 billion but less than $600 billion over 10 years if the Bush cuts were extended. He called that a \"best guess.\"\n",
              "-- Fieldhouse, of the Economic Policy Institute, used Tax Policy Center data and came up with $523-$570 billion, with the caveat that there are some limitations to the data and complicating factors.\n",
              "-- William McBride, chief economist at the Tax Foundation, called Biden’s number \"plausible\" but considers the Tax Policy Center model too limited.\n",
              "\"The economy is much more integrated than they pretend, so tax cuts ‘for the rich’ or ‘for the poor’ are really tax cuts for the private sector ultimately in that the money flows back and forth through multiple transactions,\" he said.\n",
              "Meanwhile, Romney campaign spokesman Darrel Ng said they came up with $407 billion, based on another set of data from the same source. Williams said the Romney campaign number was from outdated figures, but in the ballpark of other estimates.\n",
              "So, there’s a basis for Biden’s $500 billion figure, with the footnote that the numbers are unofficial and somewhat rough.\n",
              "Let’s turn to the VP’s view that the Bush tax cuts were \"for the wealthy.\"\n",
              "One way to judge that is who would benefit if they were permanently extended.\n",
              "The benefits of the reduced capital gains rates and dividends rate, and the cuts in top income tax rates, skew heavily in favor of higher earners, the Congressional Research Service found in a December 2010 study . But the marriage penalty change and cuts in the lowest three income tax rates benefit taxpayers of all incomes, that study showed. The expanded child tax credit helps all but the top fifth of earners.\n",
              "Overall, the top fifth of earners got 65 percent of the savings from the Bush cuts as a whole, according to a Tax Policy Center study of the cuts’ impact as of 2010. In contrast, the three-fifths bunched in the middle-income tiers got 34 percent. The top 0.1 percent -- the group Biden referred to -- got 19.7 percent of the savings.\n",
              "The same trend held for the effect on tax rates. The upper 20 percent saw a much greater reduction in their tax rate than did the lower tiers.\n",
              "The takeaway from all of that: the Bush cuts were not just \"for the wealthy,\" but benefited higher earners more than people in lower income tiers.\n",
              "One more note: Biden is taking just one point from Romney’s tax plan when he tosses out numbers. Romney also wants to close off or limit some tax breaks.\n",
              "\"If Romney fulfills all of his tax promises, the rich would save relatively little,\" Williams wrote to us. \"They would save something, however, to the extent that economic growth contributes to the plan’s revenue neutrality.\", \"$53 million a week is coming across the border in drugs.\" In October, Rep. David McKinley, R-W.Va., visited the U.S.-Mexico border near McAllen, Texas, and argued that the United States needs stronger border security, including more border patrol agents.\n",
              "A major part of the reason that additional resources are needed, McKinley said, is the flow of drugs into the country.\n",
              "Border agents \"say you’ve got to pay attention to this — $53 million a week is coming across the border in drugs,\" he said, according to the Intelligencer , the Wheeling News-Register.\n",
              "Is this number correct? It’s more complicated than McKinley suggests, but he appears to be in the ballpark.\n",
              "We’ll start by noting that the most solid federal data available concerns drugs seized on the border. While there are estimates for the amount coming through undetected, they are necessarily more speculative.\n",
              "As a result, in this fact-check, we’ll interpret McKinley’s comment to refer to the amount being seized at the border. (McKinley’s office did not provide PolitiFact with further information.)\n",
              "Here’s the most recent data on drug seizures — cocaine, heroin, marijuana, methamphetamine, and fentanyl — from Customs and Border Protection .\n",
              "The official and most consistent way that Customs and Border Protection measures seizures is by pounds, not by value, an agency spokesman told us. So to approximate the value, we turned to other data sources on drug value.\n",
              "For cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine, we used data published in October 2018 by the Drug Enforcement Administration and, for marijuana, we used data from the University of Colorado.\n",
              "For fentanyl, information on value was unavailable from these sources. We decided to use a rough approximation of street value used by the Orange County, Calif., sheriff’s office in calculating the size of a bust in October 2019.\n",
              "The following chart summarizes the approximate value of the fiscal year 2019 seizures. To create the chart, we converted pounds to grams.\n",
              "Once you divide the total by 52 weeks in a year, the value is about $44.2 million per week.\n",
              "That’s less than the $53 million figure McKinley cited, but it’s in the ballpark considering that the street value of drugs can fluctuate over time.\n",
              "\"There are no hard data, but I find the statistics cited to be consistent and certainly reasonable,\" said Bruce Bagley, a professor of international studies at the University of Miami who has studied the drug trade.\n",
              "We should also note that the price per gram for cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine is calculated on a pure gram of the substance. It’s unclear how pure the seizures were. In addition, the marijuana price data is for Colorado, a state where the drug is legal, and does not reflect the nation as a whole.\n",
              "Another caveat: Even though McKinley visited the southern U.S. border, the seizure totals include those made on both the Mexican border and the Canadian border. That said, the DEA says that the southwestern border with Mexico \"remains the primary entry point for heroin into the United States\" and that \"Mexico remains the most significant foreign source for marijuana available in the United States.\", \"$575 billion cut from Medicare in Trump’s proposed 2020 budget.\" President Donald Trump set his sights on a central Florida retirement community to lay out his vision on Medicare, even as House Democrats pursued an impeachment inquiry.\n",
              "As his visit to The Villages neared, Florida Democrats attacked Trump’s record on Medicare, suggesting he wants to weaken the health care program for the elderly. A Sept. 30 tweet from the state party about Trump's \"toxic record\" included a graphic that says \"$575 billion cut from Medicare in Trump’s proposed 2020 budget.\"\n",
              "That statement is misleading. That is a projected reduction of future spending over a decade for the health care program for the elderly. And it’s worth noting that President Barack Obama called for trimming Medicare spending, too.\n",
              "Trump’s proposed budget\n",
              "The first thing to know about Trump’s 2020 budget proposal is that it is just an expression of Trump’s priorities and ideas. The changes proposed by Trump to slow down the growth in spending will only occur if Congress passes a law.\n",
              "Medicare spending rises just about every year in Trump's budget proposal . Medicare is projected to grow by about $10 trillion over a decade.\n",
              "The Medicare cost reduction under Trump’s budget is expected to be roughly $600 billion over the next 10 years, when compared to current spending levels, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office ’s analysis in May.\n",
              "The bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget largely agrees, saying Trump’s  budget proposal reduces Medicare spending by $515 billion or $575 billion.\n",
              "About 85% of the savings comes from reductions in what Medicare pays to providers.\n",
              "\"Those cuts would primarily reduce what Medicare pays providers, and I would not expect them to have negative effects on Medicare beneficiaries,\" Matt Fiedler, an economics fellow at the left-leaning Brookings Institution, previously told PolitiFact. \"The budget’s Medicare proposals are also, in my view, largely sensible policy.\"\n",
              "Not all of the proposed cuts land on providers , however.\n",
              "Changes in Medicare’s Part D prescription drug insurance program might be the clearest example of Medicare cuts in the Trump budget that affect ordinary Americans. While one proposal would cap out-of-pocket costs for people with the very highest drug costs, another would expose people below that cost level to higher fees. At the end of the day, the Trump budget reduces payments for people who rely on prescription drugs by $50 billion. The idea of reducing the growth of Medicare isn’t new — and many of Trump’s ideas build upon ideas originally proposed in President Obama's budgets .\n",
              "Obama’s last budget proposed trimming Medicare spending by $420 billion over 10 years. (Republicans accused Obama and Democrats of cutting Medicare many times, a claim we never rated better than Half True .), \"$700 billion was robbed (from Medicare) to pay for Obamacare.\" Former Arkansas Gov.

              "Huckabee's provocative comment concluded a wonkish back-and-forth between him and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie about entitlement reform. Christie defended his plan to raise the retirement age and change benefits for Social Security and Medicare, but Huckabee stressed that Uncle Sam was to blame.\n",
              "\"If Congress wants to mess with the retirement program, why don't we let them start by changing their retirement program, and not have one, instead of talking about getting rid of Social Security and Medicare that was robbed $700 billion to pay for Obamacare?\" Huckabee said.\n",
              "This claim -- that the Affordable Care Act is funded by plundering the health care program of seniors -- is an old Republican talking point, dating back to the 2010 midterm elections. We’ve checked out many versions of this claim , which contains some truth but is misleading.\n",
              "Obamacare doesn’t literally \"rob\" Medicare. But the Affordable Care Act does include provisions that reduce future increases in Medicare spending. In other words, the law slows down the rising costs of Medicare.\n",
              "It’s also important to note that the savings come at the expense of insurers and hospitals, not beneficiaries. (The $700 billion figure is also old, from a 2012 report by the Congressional Budget Office. It’s now updated to about $800 billion .)\n",
              "Under President George W. Bush, private insurers began to run a subset of Medicare plans with the idea that more competition produced lower costs. However, those plans grew to cost more than traditional Medicare, so the Affordable Care Act pared down the payments to private insurers.\n",
              "Hospitals would also find their checks docked when they failed to to meet benchmarks for patient care.\n",
              "On the flip side, the Affordable Care Act also funds illness prevention benefits, expands preventive care benefits, and provides $48 billion for prescription coverage.\n",

              "Voting in the wrong precinct is the biggest reason, after change of address, for provisional ballots. Provisional ballots can be cast in the wrong precinct because poll workers accidentally send voters to the wrong table in a polling place with multiple precincts, or to the wrong polling place, which can follow an error such as a poll worker misreading a street guide.\n",
              "Reports from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission show that relatively few states reject significant numbers of provisional ballots because they were cast in the wrong precinct. Only New York and Arizona rejected more wrong precinct ballots than Ohio in 2008, according to the EAC, and those three states accounted for the majority of the nation's total.\n",

              "We’re not rating whether HB 194 will worsen those problems. But that the legislation  \"permits, instead of requires, an election official to direct a voter who is in the wrong precinct to the voter's correct precinct,\" shows it’s not an attempt to aggressively address the issue.\n",
              "The duty remains on the individual voter to ensure that a ballot is cast in the correct precinct., \"(After the auto bailout) General Motors is back on top as the world’s No. 1 automaker.\" President Barack Obama used his 2012 State of the Union address to tout the success of the federal auto bailout — not that he called it that.\n",
              "\"We got the industry to retool and restructure,\" he said. \"Today, General Motors is back on top as the world’s No. 1 automaker.\"\n",
              "We wondered: Is an American car manufacturer again ruling the roost?\n",
              "The claim\n",
              "Here's how the president set up his claim:\n",
              "\"On the day I took office, our auto industry was on the verge of collapse. Some even said we should let it die. With a million jobs at stake, I refused to let that happen. In exchange for help, we demanded responsibility. We got workers and automakers to settle their differences. We got the industry to retool and restructure. Today, General Motors is back on top as the world’s No. 1 automaker. Chrysler has grown faster in the U.S. than any major car company. Ford is investing billions in U.S. plants and factories. And together, the entire industry added nearly 160,000 jobs. We bet on American workers. We bet on American ingenuity. And tonight, the American auto industry is back.\"\n",
              "The U.S. government did sink billions of dollars into the auto industry through the Troubled Asset Relief Program to keep GM and Chrysler from going under. (Though not Ford, which refused that federal money.) In return, it got an ownership stake in GM, now down to about one-third of the company's common stock . And while the automakers haven't exactly repaid the government in full, as executives claimed this summer , overall, a senior editor at Fortune has calculated that TARP has made taxpayers money .\n",
              "Meanwhile, U.S. automakers' sales, including Ford's, are rising.\n",
              "Who's No. 1\n",
              "Obama's speech used a statistic reported just days earlier: GM and its partners, by selling 9 million vehicles in 2011, once again became the world's top-selling automaker. (GM automobiles include Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick and GMC.)\n",
              "The company edged out Toyota, which grabbed the top spot in 2008 as the U.S. economy struggled.\n",
              "Analysts said the turnaround stems from the popularity of its latest vehicles, such as the Chevy Cruze, according to the  Washington Post and others. Sales worldwide rose 7.6 percent , an increase of 640,000 more cars and trucks in 2011 from the year before, according to ABC News and the Los Angeles Times. Nearly 4.8 million of the 9 million were sold by Chevrolet.\n",
              "\"It is an accomplishment that GM has been able to reverse the tide in the U.S. and Asia, and they are doing very well in emerging markets considering just a few years ago the company was in real challenging straights,\" said John F. Hoffecker, an auto industry consultant with AlixPartners, told the Los Angeles Times .\n",
              "But there are a few caveats to Obama's claim that the bailout put GM back on top.\n",
              "\"Luck is incredibly important — as we've seen for GM these last 12 months,\" said Jeremy Anwyl, vice chairman of auto information site Edmunds.com . \"They were really able to benefit from conditions in the marketplace.\"\n",
              "Consider:\n",
              "• GM's sales number is based on sales by both GM and its joint ventures in China, which aren't wholly owned subsidiaries. That's led Volkswagen, which says it sold 8.2 million vehicles last year, to challenge GM's claim to the top spot. \"Rankings are mostly about bragging rights, but there has been a long-running and robust debate over how to account for vehicles sold through affiliates,\" Reuters reported . \"... Some analysts extract those sales from GM's results.\"\n",
              "• Toyota, which hasn't yet reported results for the full year, had to grapple with an earthquake and tsunami in Japan and floods in Thailand. So GM's main competition saw its production and sales decrease. It predicts its sales are down about 6 percent, Reuters reported . Meanwhile, merely the news that Toyota might experience shortages drove up summer demand for American vehicles, Anwyl said.\n",
              "• GM, in addition to getting TARP funds, also went through bankruptcy in 2009. \"Companies typically rebound as they exit bankruptcy,\" Anwyl said. (Of course, it's important to note that the bankruptcy reorganization was made possible by taxpayer funds.)\n",
              "• Ford, which didn't accept TARP funds, has seen its sales increase 11 percent — without Obama's help to \"retool and restructure.\" (It didn't need the bailout in large part because of good timing — it had raised significant money while money was still easy to get, before the credit crunch created by the economic crisis, Anwyl said.)\n",
              "\"I think if we're really being fair about the bailouts ... you almost have to wait another two or three years to see how this plays out,\" Anwyl said.\n",
              "And it won't be easy next year for GM to hold onto its top spot. Its midsize Cruze, for example, will face competition from recent models from Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Toyota and Volkswagen.\n",
              "\"That's a staggering amount of competition,\" Anwyl said., \"(Assembly Democrats) wanted to raise the gas tax by $2.4 billion. We said no to that....They’re down on the ground. They’re sweating. They’re twitching. It’s ugly, ‘cause I keep saying no.\" The way Gov. Chris Christie makes it sound, Democrats in the state Assembly are a bunch of crazed junkies looking for their next fix of raising taxes and he’s the one forcing them into withdrawal.\n",
              "At a June 13 town hall meeting in Atlantic County, the Republican governor pointed to his opposition to a proposed gas tax increase as an example of him fighting off the Democrats’ addiction.\n",
              "\"Now I’ve been governor now for over 800 days and we vetoed two income tax increases. They wanted to raise the gas tax by $2.4 billion. We said no to that,\" said Christie, according to a video posted June 14 on YouTube. \"Imagine now if you’re paying 20 to 25 cents more a gallon. That’s what the Assembly Democrats would have gotten for you. We’re saying no to all that stuff.\n",
              "\"So now…you got to see what’s happening with the Assembly Democrats. They’re like people going through withdrawals. They haven’t gotten to raise a tax in over 800 days. They’re down on the ground. They’re sweating. They’re twitching. It’s ugly, ‘cause I keep saying no.\"\n",
              "Such colorful language, and yet so misleading, PolitiFact New Jersey found.\n",
              "There has been a proposal to raise the motor fuels tax by about $2.4 billion, but despite Christie’s suggestion, it hasn’t been pushed by the Assembly Democratic leadership and stopped by the governor. In fact, the legislation has never made it to the governor’s desk for him to take any action.\n",
              "State Assemblyman Albert Coutinho (D-Essex) has introduced the bill twice over the last roughly two years, but has never received additional legislative sponsors or a committee hearing. The full Assembly has never voted on the proposal.\n",
              "As Coutinho put it, \"this bill is going nowhere.\"\n",
              "First introduced in May 2010, Coutinho’s bill called for annual increases of 8-cents-per-gallon in fiscal years 2011 through 2013. According to the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, those increases were projected to generate a total of about $2.4 billion over the three-year period to go toward the state’s Transportation Trust Fund.\n",
              "Coutinho said the tax hike would allow the state to stop borrowing for the fund, which supports various transportation projects.\n",
              "But the bill, which Coutinho reintroduced in January for the current legislative session, hasn’t moved an inch since being referred to an Assembly committee.\n",
              "\"Leadership’s not looking to do this,\" Coutinho told us. \"Nobody seems willing to politically have that conversation.\"\n",
              "Tom Hester Jr., a spokesman for the Assembly Democrats, explained that Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver does not support raising the gas tax.\n",
              "\"Hundreds if not thousands of bills are proposed each session without getting a hearing. Nothing unusual about it at all,\" Hester said in an e-mail. \"The governor is once again misleading the public.\"\n",
              "Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak noted how other Democrats have indicated support for a gas tax increase, including state Sen. Raymond Lesniak and state Assemblyman and state Democratic Party chairman John Wisniewski.\n",
              "As for Christie’s role in stopping such a tax hike, Drewniak added: \"The Governor was emphatic many times amid this discussion by Democrats that he would not sign legislation increasing the gasoline tax and add a new tax burden on over-taxed New Jersey residents.\n",
              "\"The unambiguous promise of a veto is often just as effective in stopping legislation in its tracks as is the actual act of a veto.\", \"(Barack Obama) says he’s going to reduce the long-term debt and deficit by $4 trillion, doesn’t say how he's going to do it.\" For the news media citing a lack of detail in Mitt Romney’s proposals, Gov. Chris Christie offers these instructions: be fair to the Republican presidential nominee and get tough on President Barack Obama for not providing the specifics behind his own promises.\n",
              "During an interview Sunday on NBC’s \"Meet the Press,\" host David Gregory noted how Romney has failed to enumerate which tax deductions he would eliminate, and asked Christie whether Romney would provide those details during Wednesday’s debate.\n",
              "The New Jersey governor argued that the media should be \"just as tough on the president\" for failing to explain how he would reduce the federal deficit by $4 trillion.\n",
              "\"He says he’s going to reduce the long-term debt and deficit by $4 trillion, doesn’t say how he’s going to do it,\" Christie, a Republican, told Gregory. \"I mean, you know, let’s be fair here.\"\n",
              "The governor repeated that claim later in the interview, saying Obama \"puts out a nice two-minute ad that says he’s going to reduce the debt by four trillion, but never tells us how.\"\n",
              "OK, governor, let’s be fair: you’re wrong to claim Obama has not outlined his deficit reduction plan.\n",
              "In an 80-page report issued in September 2011 and again in the president’s budget proposal released in February, the Obama administration has laid out detailed proposals and dollar amounts for how to achieve more than $4 trillion in savings over the next decade.\n",
              "The governor’s office did not respond to two e-mails seeking comment.\n",
              "Let’s explain some of those details.\n",
              "Obama’s deficit reduction plan relies on a mix of tax reductions for some, tax hikes for others and spending cuts.\n",
              "A large part of the savings would come from roughly $1.5 trillion worth of tax reform measures. For instance, the plan would allow federal income tax cuts to expire for upper-income taxpayers, while extending them for other Americans.\n",
              "The president’s plan also would reduce certain tax deductions for upper-income taxpayers and close various tax loopholes, such as by ending tax breaks for oil and gas companies.\n",
              "In many cases, the reform proposals are so specific that only tax policy wonks may really understand them.\n",
              "Another roughly $850 billion in savings would come from winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to the president’s budget. In addition, the deficit reduction plan accounts for roughly $1 trillion in spending cuts built into legislation signed by the president last year.\n",
              "The Obama administration also has provided specific proposals for more than $500 billion in spending cuts and reforms to mandatory programs.\n",
              "Those provisions include changes to Medicare and Medicaid; a reduction in certain agricultural subsidies; and a series of reforms within the U.S. Postal Service, such as reducing mail delivery from six days to five days per week.\n",
              "However, the president’s plan has received both praise and criticism.\n",
              "\"Such a balanced approach -- both increases in revenues and reductions in spending -- is the only approach that will put the budget on an economically and politically sustainable path,\" wrote James R. Horney, vice president of Federal Fiscal Policy for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank.\n",
              "But Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan organization focused on debt reduction, said in a news release that \"the use of this war gimmick is quite troubling.\n",
              "\"Drawing down spending on wars that were already set to wind down and that were deficit financed in the first place should not be considered savings,\" she said., \"(Big banks) have invested over $300,000 in (Joe Heck), and Heck has sponsored $44 million dollars in tax breaks for banks.\" A pro-Democratic Super PAC with close ties to Nevada Sen. Harry Reid is spending roughly $850,000 on a new ad attempting to paint Republican Rep. Joe Heck as a creature of Wall Street.\n",
              "Senate Majority PAC’s new ad suggests that banks \"invested\" in the Republican Senate hopeful through campaign donations, and that their investment paid off.\n",
              "\"They’ve invested over $300,000 in him, and Heck has sponsored $44 million dollars in tax breaks for banks,\" the ad states .\n",
              "This ad marks one of the largest chunks of outside spending in the highly competitive Nevada Senate race. But claiming banks invested in Heck and then received tax breaks takes an acrobatic chronology of what actually happened.\n",
              "Donations\n",
              "Over his entire congressional career, Heck has actually raised more than the $300,000 amount from the banking industry referenced in the ad. The most recent figure from the \"secruities and investment\" category on the nonpartisan opensecrets.org is $473,819.\n",
              "However, this is a career-wide total, and it includes the $381,700 raised for his ongoing Senate run. Heck raised $92,119, a much more modest figure, for his other three congressional runs combined.\n",
              "That’s a lot of money, but it’s worth taking the typically massive size of congressional fundraising hauls into consideration.\n",
              "For example, Heck’s $35,472 in donations from the \"securities and investment\" industry during his successful 2014 re-election bid is a drop in the bucket compared to the total $2.4 million raised throughout that campaign.\n",
              "And as for references to \"investing,\" the tax breaks mentioned in the ad actually refer to a bill Heck championed as a state senator — years before the $300,000 in donations referenced in the ad.\n",
              "Heck did take campaign funds from banks and their associated PACs during this time. A PolitiFact tally found that Heck received around $21,800 from the banking industry through his four years in the state Senate.\n",
              "Again, that isn’t a small figure, but it’s a much smaller amount than what Heck raked in from the state’s casino giants and the medical industry over the same time period.\n",
              "Tax breaks\n",
              "Regardless of the donations, Heck did sponsor an ultimately failed piece of legislation in the state Senate that sought to reduce the payroll tax burden on Nevada financial institutions — what the ad calls \"$44 million in tax breaks for banks.\"\n",
              "Though the ad prominently features a looming image of the U.S. Capitol Dome, the bill would have only applied to Nevada banks.\n",
              "We’ve previously explored the somewhat confusing history of Nevada’s payroll tax (also called the Modified Business Tax , or MBT), created as a compromise to fund new K-12 education programs during a fierce 2003 battle over new taxes.\n",
              "State lawmakers historically fiddle with the exact rates and exemptions levels for the payroll tax, but there has been one constant — banks and other financial institutions are charged at a higher rate than any other business (2 percent), and also pay so-called \"franchise taxes\" for each branch office past the first one in each county ($7,000 a year).\n",
              "Nevada bankers have long grumbled about the higher tax rates, and have attempted to reduce them back down to the level paid by other state businesses, most recently in 2015 .\n",
              "That’s what Heck was doing in 2007 when he introduced SB 233 , which proposed rolling back the payroll tax rate on banks to the level applied to other state businesses and repealing the \"franchise tax\" for multiple branch offices.\n",
              "Saying the bill was about \"equity and fairness,\" Heck argued that the higher rate applied to banks created more tax revenue than projected and stifled the industry’s economic growth.\n",
              "\"This could be a bill about basket weavers,\" he said at a committee hearing . \"This bill is about an inequitable system that singles out an industry for a tax the rest of business and industry does not pay.\"\n",
              "Democrats on the committee said banks were uniquely prepared to handle a higher tax burden, and that they weren’t suffering at the time despite the higher taxes.\n",
              "\"I have not seen a bank go out of business in this state; the banks I am aware of are setting record profits,\" Democratic state Sen. Mike Schneider said during a hearing on the bill.\n",
              "As for the tax-cut figure, both the state’s Taxation Department and Heck himself estimated the legislation would cost the state around $44.2 million in revenue — a little more than $38 million in payroll taxes and another $5.9 million by axing the branch franchise tax.\n",
              "Heck pointed out that those cuts would make up less than 1 percent of the state’s $6.9 billion two-year budget. The bill itself would have affected around 2,450 Nevada businesses at the time, and the amended version would have lowered the tax for the 55,000 businesses paying the payroll levy.\n",
              "Heck wasn’t the only Republican leading the charge on reducing the tax burden for banks, as former Gov. Jim Gibbons made repealing the bank franchise tax a priority in his 2007 State of the State address.\n",
              "Ultimately, the bill went nowhere. After being amended and passed out of committee, Senate leaders placed it in legislative limbo and let it expire without any more votes.\n",
              "Although lawmakers approved major changes to the state’s payroll tax in 2015, the higher rate on financial institutions hasn’t changed since 2003.\n",
              "Senate Majority PAC spokesman Shripal Shah said the measure indicated to the banking industry that Heck would be in their corner if elected to Senate.\n",
              "\"Banks have invested in Joe Heck's campaigns because they know he has a history of working for their interests and would continue doing their bidding in the Senate if he has the opportunity,\" he said in an email.\n",
              "Regardless, this isn’t the first time Heck’s opponents have tried to ding him over the proposal. Democratic Congresswoman Dina Titus criticized him over it during a 2010 debate between the two House candidates.\n",
              "Heck responded with largely the same language he used in testifying for the bill in 2007, saying the point was to make the state’s tax system more equitable., \"(Bill) Ayers and Obama ran a radical education foundation together.\" For most of the election, Sen. John McCain's campaign has been somewhat subtle about trying to tie Sen. Barack Obama to the former '60s radical William Ayers.\n",
              "No longer. A 90-second Web ad released Oct. 8, 2008, features sinister music, side-by-side photographs of Obama and Ayers, and a series of dubious allegations about their past connections, including this one:\n",
              "\"Ayers and Obama ran a radical education foundation together.\"\n",
              "Ayers was a founding member of the militant Vietnam-era anti-war group the Weathermen. He was investigated for his role in a series of domestic bombings, but the charges were dropped in 1974 due to prosecutorial misconduct. He is now an education professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and actively engaged in the city's civic life.\n",
              "The McCain campaign said the \"radical education foundation\" to which they were referring is the Chicago Annenberg Challenge, a charity endowed by publishing magnate Walter Annenberg that funded public-school programs in Chicago from 1995 to 2001.\n",
              "We'll look at whether the foundation was radical. But first we have to grapple with whether Obama and Ayers ran it.\n",
              "Obama served on the foundation's volunteer board from its inception in 1995 through its dissolution in 2001, and was chair for the first four years. So an argument can be made that he ran it, though an executive director handled day-to-day operations.\n",
              "Ayers, who received his doctorate in education from Columbia University in 1987 and is now a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, was active in getting the foundation up and running. He and two other activists led the effort to secure the grant from Annenberg, and he worked without pay in the early months of 1995, prior to the board's hiring of an executive director, to help the foundation get incorporated and formulate its bylaws, said Ken Rolling, who was the foundation's only executive director. Ayers went on to become a member of the \"collaborative,\" an advisory group that advised the board of directors and the staff.\n",
              "However, Ayers \"was never on the board of the Chicago Annenberg Challenge,\" and he \"never made a decision programmatically or had a vote,\" Rolling said.\n",
              "\"He (Ayers) was at board meetings — which, by the way, were open — as a guest,\" Rolling said. \"That is not anything near Bill Ayers and Barack Obama running the Chicago Annenberg Challenge.\"\n",
              "Now, was the foundation radical?\n",
              "The McCain campaign cited several pieces of evidence for that allegation, including a 1995 invitation from the foundation for applications from schools \"that want to make radical changes in the way teachers teach and students learn.\" The campaign appears to have confused two different definitions of the word \"radical.\" Clearly the invitation referred to \"a considerable departure from the usual or traditional,\" rather than \"advocating extreme measures to retain or restore a political state of affairs.\"\n",
              "The campaign also cited two projects the foundation funded, one having to do with a United Nations-themed Peace School and another that focused on African-American studies.\n",
              "\"That is radical in the eye of this campaign and we imagine in the eyes of most Americans,\" said Michael Goldfarb, a spokesman for McCain. \"It is a subjective thing, and there are going to be people in Berkeley and Chicago who think that is totally legitimate.\"\n",
              "Teaching about the United Nations and African-American studies may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's hardly \"radical\" in the same way Ayers' Vietnam-era activities were. Moreover, most of the projects the foundation funded (more on that below) were not remotely controversial.\n",
              "The McCain campaign also cited an opinion piece by conservative commentator Stanley Kurtz in the Sept. 23, 2008,\n",
              "Wall Street Journal\n",
              "as evidence of the foundation's radicalism. Kurtz wrote that Ayers was the \"guiding spirit\" of the foundation, and it \"translated Mr. Ayers's radicalism into practice.\"\n",
              "But Ayers' views on education, though certainly reform-oriented and left-of-center, are not considered anywhere near as radical as his Vietnam-era views on war. And even if they were, there was a long list of individuals involved with the Chicago Annenberg Challenge whose positions provided them far more authority over its direction than Ayers' advisory role gave him.\n",
              "Let's look at a few, starting with the funder. Annenberg was a lifelong Republican and former ambassador to the United Kingdom under President Richard Nixon. His widow, Leonore, has endorsed McCain. Kurtz might just as plausibly have accused Obama and the foundation of \"translating Annenberg's conservatism into practice.\"\n",
              "Among the other board members who served with Obama were: Stanley Ikenberry, former president of the University of Illinois; Arnold Weber, former president of Northwestern University and assistant secretary of labor in the Nixon administration; Scott Smith, then publisher of the Chicago Tribune; venture capitalist Edward Bottum; John McCarter, president of the Field Museum; Patricia Albjerg Graham, former dean of the Harvard University Graduate School of Education, and a host of other mainstream folks.\n",
              "\"The whole idea of it being radical when it was this tie of blue-chip, white-collar, CEOs and civic leaders is just ridiculous,\" said the foundation's former development director, Marianne Philbin.\n",
              "The foundation gave money to groups of public schools – usually three to 10 – who partnered with some sort of outside organization to improve their students' achievement.\n",
              "In his opinion piece, Kurtz puts a sinister spin on this: \"Instead of funding schools directly, it required schools to affiliate with 'external partners,' which actually got the money...CAC disbursed money through various far-left community organizers, such as the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (or ACORN).\"\n",
              "Rollings said the foundation tried to fund the schools directly, but doing so proved to be a \"bureaucratic nightmare.\" But any external group that received money had to have created a program in partnership with a network of public schools.\n",
              "And though ACORN is considered a liberal organization, the vast majority of the foundation's external partners were not remotely controversial. Here are a few examples: the Chicago Symphony, the University of Chicago, Loyola University, Northwestern University, the Chicago Children's Museum, the Museum of Science and Industry, the Field Museum, the Commercial Club of Chicago, the Garfield Park Conservatory Alliance and the Logan Square Neighborhood Association.\n",
              "Had Kurtz chosen to accuse Obama of carrying water for the conservative Annenberg, he might have written: \"CAC disbursed money to various business-friendly entities, such as the Museum of Science and Industry and the Commercial Club of Chicago.\"\n",
              "See how easy it is?\n",
              "The programs the foundation funded were designed to allow individuals from the \"external partners\" – whether the musicians in the symphony or the business leaders in the commercial club – to help improve student achievement. They were along the lines of mentoring by artists, literacy instruction, professional development for teachers and administrators, and training for parents in everything from computer skills to helping their children with homework to advocating for their children at school.\n",
              "This last activity – something suburban parents practice with zeal – is also suspect in Kurtz's view: \"CAC records show that board member Arnold Weber was concerned that parents 'organized' by community groups might be viewed by school principals 'as a political threat.'\" That is typical of Kurtz's essay – relatively innocuous facts cast in the worst possible light. That's appropriate for an opinion piece, perhaps, but hardly grounds for a purportedly factual political ad accusing the group of radicalism.\n",
              "We could go on and on with evidence that the Chicago Annenberg Challenge was a rather vanilla charitable group. For example, under the deal with Annenberg every dollar from him had to be matched by two from elsewhere. The co-funders were a host of respected, mainstream institutions, such as the National Science Foundation, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation and the Chicago Public Schools.\n",
              "In short, this was a mainstream foundation funded by a mainstream, Republican business leader and led by an overwhelmingly mainstream, civic-minded group of individuals. Ayers' involvement in its inception and on an advisory committee do not make it radical – nor does the funding of programs involving the United Nations and African-American studies.\n",
              "This attack is false, but it's more than that – it's malicious. It unfairly tars not just Obama, but all the other prominent, well-respected Chicagoans who also volunteered their time to the foundation. They came from all walks of life and all political backgrounds, and there's ample evidence their mission was nothing more than improving ailing public schools in Chicago. Yet in the heat of a political campaign they have been accused of financing radicalism. That's Pants on Fire wrong., \"(Bill) McCollum also voted for numerous amendments to weaken the legislation, even voting to make trains less accessible to those in wheelchairs.\" Gubernatorial hopeful Bill McCollum has been in politics for much of his adult life, charting a wide map of potential minefields for his enemies to use against him.\n",
              "The Florida Democratic Party, no stranger to partisan warfare, took such aim in a July 26, 2010, press release, using the 20th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act to remind voters of McCollum's initial concerns about the sweeping civil rights legislation.\n",
              "\"Earlier this year, McCollum said he was proud of his efforts to pass the ADA when he was in Congress, noting there was 'Great Resistance' to the bill. McCollum neglected to state that he was a major player in the 'Great Resistance,' \" wrote party spokesman Eric Jotkoff in the press release.\n",
              "The press release goes on, \"He urged then-President George H.W. Bush to reconsider his support of the ADA ... McCollum also voted for numerous amendments to weaken the legislation, even voting to make trains less accessible to those in wheelchairs. McCollum then voted for final passage of the ADA, saying 'politically, it's a very tough vote.' \"\n",
              "The Americans with Disabilities Act, signed into law July 26, 1990, is considered one of the nation's most important civil rights victories. It requires that disabled Americans be provided reasonable access to employment, transportation, public buildings and communications services. It is widely supported by Republicans and Democrats alike, although some conservatives, libertarians and business groups have long expressed concern that the law puts an undue burden on public servants and employers to accommodate the disabled.\n",
              "The Democrats' claim that McCollum, who represented Florida in Congress for two decades, tried to water down the legislation and didn't want to help people in wheelchairs is an emotional charge. We wondered, is it true?\n",
              "In fact, congressional records show McCollum voted for several amendments to the bill.\n",
              "He supported Amendment 448, which would have specified that the costs required to accommodate the employment of a disabled person not exceed 10 percent of the annual salary or the annualized hourly wage of that job. In debate, McCollum said the amendment, \"may be the most significant one from the standpoint of mitigating the cost to small business.\" It failed 187-213 on May 17, 1990. \"Today, we are going to say that a company manager who earns $40,000 is entitled to a greater accommodation that the mail clerk who receives a salary of $15,000?\" argued Rep. Dwayne Payne, D-N.J., according to congressional records.\n",
              "On May 22, 1990, the day the legislation passed in the House, records show McCollum voted for Amendment 452, which sought to exempt commuter rail services from the requirement that all new rail cars be readily accessible by persons with disabilities if the commuter rail service made at least one car per train accessible for the disabled. To qualify for the exemption, a rail service would have to add more accessible cars if the demand could not be met by just one car. Proponents of the rail amendment argued that the change offered more specific requirements, albeit different ones, than the original bill, and therefore provided greater protection. For example, the bill required all new purchased or leased buses and rail cars be accessible to the disabled but did not require retrofitting of existing vehicles. The amendment, singled out by the Florida Democratic Party in its press release, failed 110-290. The New York Times wrote at the time, \"opponents said the effect of the proposed changes would be to segregate people with disabilities.\"\n",
              "McCollum also voted for Amendment 453 that day, which sought to provide an annual exemption to public transit systems in urban areas with populations of less than 200,000 from the bill's requirement that new vehicles be accessible to people with disabilities, including wheelchair users. To qualify for the exemption, the transit system would have to develop an alternative plan, such as a Dial-a-Ride service. \"It is the people who need to get from their home to where they want to go, the people who cannot get to the bus stop, are the people who are going to suffer,\" said sponsor Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Penn. The amendment failed 148-266. \"A civil right to equal transportation services does not diminish according to a city's population in the latest census,\" said Rep. Norman Mineta, D-Calif., according to Congressional Quarterly.\n",
              "Finally, McCollum voted for Amendment 454, which sought to keep plaintiffs from suing for monetary damages by limiting the remedies available to discrimination victims to those provided under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, such as injunctive relief, back pay and attorney fees. Supporters argued the disabled should not have greater remedies than those available to women and minorities under the 1964 law. The amendment failed 192-227. \"You have lesser rights if you have lesser remedies,\" said Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., at the time, according to Congressional Quarterly.\n",
              "On that amendment, McCollum argued at the time: \"The real problem I have had with the ADA bill altogether, and I am going to vote for this bill, even though a lot of people think that I am out here with a lot of amendments and I am opposed, I am not, because I think the disabled need to have a civil rights bill like this one. I think the problem we have had all along has been costs. It has been a question of how do we mitigate, how do we reduce, costs. It is far more complex under the civil rights legislation for the handicapped than it is for race or sex or any other kind of discrimination. There may be as many as 900, some people say, 900 different disabilities covered by this legislation. There are innumerable different situations in the workplace where the handicapped of different types will intermesh, and those situations will have to be resolved hopefully through processes that are short of litigation. It will be expensive, and even if there is a resolution occasionally by litigation, that will undoubtedly be a very expensive route.\"\n",
              "McCollum then joined the majority to pass the legislation in a 403-20 vote.\n",
              "So, would the amendments he supported have weakened the legislation? The McCollum campaign did not respond to our questions on this point.\n",
              "But many experts on disability law said the amendments did attempt to undercut the bill.\n",
              "\"These amendments sought to narrow the rights provided to individuals with disabilities,\" said Ruth Colker, author of The Disability Pendulum: The First Decade of the Americans with Disabilities Act and a law professor at Ohio State University.\n",
              "The amendments were \"more pro business and anti-worker,\" said Paul Steven Miller, a University of Washington law professor and a former commissioner on the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the federal agency that enforces employment discrimination laws. \"They sort of run counter to what the ADA seeks to accomplish.\"\n",
              "We also checked whether the law was eventually altered to reflect the amendments supported by McCollum. It wasn't. To this day, Americans with disabilities can sue for monetary damages, there is no fiscal cap on how much an employer may spend to accommodate a disabled employer, and transportation systems still must be accessible.\n",
              "To be sure, the Americans with Disabilities Act does have its critics.\n",
              "After the legislation's passage, the libertarian Cato Institute published a policy analysis by economist Robert O'Quinn, that concluded, \"the ADA so zealously pursues its mainstreaming goal that individuals, businesses, and governmental bodies must make expensive accommodations to ensure full integration even when less costly, more convenient alternatives, which are preferred by disabled individuals, are available.\"\n",
              "He continued, \"The ADA is objectionable on moral as well as economic grounds. In a free society the government should employ its coercive powers only to protect the life, liberty, and property of its citizens from aggression. Any attempt to enforce moral behavior, however noble or desirable, is beyond the proper scope of government.\"\n",
              "In contrast, some advocates of the bill have complained that it did not go far enough.\n",
              "Our mission, however, is not to judge the value of the acclaimed legislation.\n",
              "The Florida Democratic Party claimed McCollum \"voted for numerous amendments to weaken the legislation, even voting to make trains less accessible to those in wheelchairs., \"(Bill) Nelson voted for billions in wasteful spending earmarks like the Bridge to Nowhere.\" A new Web ad from the campaign for former Sen. George LeMieux takes on Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida over the issue of earmarks and specifically ties Nelson to perhaps the most infamous earmark ever, the so-called Bridge to Nowhere.\n",
              "A narrator in the ad, called \" The Choice ,\" says, \"Nelson voted for billions in wasteful spending earmarks like the Bridge to Nowhere. LeMieux never requested a single earmark and pushed to ban them all.\"\n",
              "We're going to split this claim into two fact-checks. In this item, we are looking at the first half, about Nelson's record on earmarks. But we encourage you to also look at our companion fact-check on LeMieux's claim that he \"never requested a single earmark and pushed to ban them all.\" (It's not as black-and-white as the ad suggests).\n",
              "The claim that \"Nelson voted for billions in wasteful spending earmarks like the Bridge to Nowhere,\" is backed up in the ad with a reference to Senate Roll Call Vote 264, Oct. 20, 2005.\n",
              "That is the vote on a Highway Reauthorization Bill , which included $225 million for an Alaska bridge to connect the tiny city of Ketchikan to Gravina, an island with just a few dozen residents and an airport. The project was derisively nicknamed the Bridge to Nowhere by a government watchdog group and became a national symbol of federal pork-barrel spending.\n",
              "Nelson voted in favor of the highway bill, which passed with overwhelming bipartisan support, 93-1.\n",
              "To be clear, this was not an up-or-down vote on the Bridge to Nowhere. The bill included $286.5 billion through 2009 for highway, mass transit, safety and research programs. The Alaska bridge was less than a tenth of 1 percent of total spending in the bill. We couldn't find any evidence prior to the vote that Nelson had an opinion about the Alaska bridge one way or the other.\n",
              "In a press release that year, Nelson touted the fact that there was $8.6 billion in the bill for Florida road projects, including widening Interstate 75 from Fort Myers to Naples; constructing the Interstate 4 crosstown connector in the Tampa Bay area; improving I-4 alternate routes in Orlando; and widening the bypass around Tallahassee.\n",
              "However, Nelson did have an opportunity to specifically eliminate funding for the Bridge to Nowhere when U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., proposed an amendment that would have redirected $125 million in funding for the Alaska bridge toward reconstruction of a New Orleans bridge damaged by Hurricane Katrina. That amendment failed 82-15, and Nelson was among those who voted against it. During the 2008 presidential campaign, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., criticized then-Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., for a similar vote. Obama and others said they voted against the Coburn amendment not because they agreed with funding for the Bridge to Nowhere, but because they felt it was wrong to single out one state's pork project without eliminating them for all the states (or, they feared their pork projects might be on the chopping block the next time).\n",
              "Incidentally, the Bridge to Nowhere never did get the money. A congressional committee directed the $225 million earmarked for the Gravina Island bridge to the Alaska Department of Transportation to spend the money as it saw fit. Although Alaska officials still could have decided to spend it on the bridge, ultimately the price tag for the project ballooned and the money was spent elsewhere.\n",
              "But back to LeMieux's claim that Nelson voted for \"billions in wasteful spending earmarks like the Bridge to Nowhere.\"\n",
              "\"He did,\" said Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that tracks federal earmarks. \"He supported bills, along with many other senators, that had billions of dollars of earmarks in them.\"\n",
              "According to an analysis by Taxpayers for Common Sense , the highway bill in question included more than 6,000 earmarks at a cost of more than $24 billion.\n",
              "\"Whether they were 'wasteful' or not all depends on who you talk to,\" Ellis said. \"But along with the the rank and file, he (Nelson) has certainly been someone who actively participated in the earmarking game. I wouldn't put him in the pantheon of earmarkers, but he certainly played the game.\"\n",
              "We've docked politicians before for stretching the truth by claiming their opponent supported the Bridge to Nowhere simply because they voted for that highway bill in 2005. But this ad paints with a broader brush, criticizing Nelson for voting for billions of dollars worth of earmarks such as the Bridge to Nowhere. Nelson may not have specifically supported the Bridge to Nowhere project, but there's no question he voted in favor of a bill that was known to include billions of dollars worth of road project earmarks, some of which Nelson had requested for Florida., \"(Birmingham, Ala.) is the cradle of the civil rights movement.\" You hear it all the time in Atlanta.\n",
              "Atlanta, many politicians, preachers and others say, is \"the cradle of the civil rights movement.\"\n",
              "Former mayor Bill Campbell said it. So has entertainer Debbie Allen. One-time Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau president Spurgeon Richardson claimed the title for the city.\n",
              "So we were quite surprised when NBC \"Today Show\" meteorologist Al Roker, who was visiting Birmingham for a charity program, referred to that city as \"the cradle of the civil rights movement.\"\n",
              "The city of Birmingham’s website says many refer to it as the cradle of the movement.\n",
              "We decided to go back in time for some answers.\n",
              "Atlanta was the birthplace of the movement’s most recognizable leader, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and his leading partners. Atlanta was also home to the movement’s leading organizations, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, whose former chairman is longtime U.S. Rep. John Lewis, (D-Atlanta).\n",
              "Birmingham was the stage for some of the most important moments of the movement. The city’s public safety director, Eugene \"Bull\" Connor, a defiant segregationist, infamously ordered firemen to spray young protesters with water hoses. King, who referred to Birmingham as the most \"segregated city\" in America, targeted the city for his non-violent campaign because of the stubbornness of its leaders to evolve on civil rights. Some called the Alabama city \"Bombingham.\" It was there, in 1963, that four black girls (ages 11-14) were killed by a bomb in a church on a Sunday morning.\n",
              "Most civil rights historians say the church bombing was the tipping point in public opinion of civil rights for blacks that resulted in federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 that desegregated public facilities, granted blacks the right to vote and prohibited job discrimination.\n",
              "So does that make Birmingham the \"cradle\" of the movement?\n",
              "NBC thought so after doing some research, said spokeswoman Megan Kopf.\n",
              "\"Other cities may be considered that as well, but since we were broadcasting from Birmingham, that is the city we mentioned,\" she said.\n",
              "Some well-regarded civil rights historians say another Alabama city may have a stronger claim.\n",
              "\"I honestly think if we assembled 30 civil rights historians and said if you had to name one place to call the cradle of the movement, I think Montgomery would get 75 percent of the vote and I think Birmingham would finish second,\" said David Garrow, a Pulitzer Prize-winning civil rights historian who served as an advisor for the acclaimed \"Eyes On The Prize\" documentary series about the movement.\n",
              "Montgomery was the setting of the historic 381-day boycott to integrate the city’s bus system. It began in late 1955 after NAACP member Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white man. The Montgomery argument is based on the definition of a cradle (\"The earliest stage,\" according to Webster’s) and the boycott is widely considered the beginning of the modern civil rights movement. Garrow said he’d vote for Montgomery.\n",
              "\"Montgomery is the cradle because of the bus boycott,\" said Taylor Branch, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author who has written extensively about King and the movement.\n",
              "Branch said Birmingham played a critical role in the movement. Birmingham was a tough steel town that was considered a bastion of segregation and considered a \"gamble\" for King. The battles there, Branch said, gave momentum to the 1963 March on Washington.\n",
              "\"It is fair to say historically that Birmingham was a tipping point, a breakthrough for the national civil rights movement,\" he said.\n",
              "What about Atlanta?\n",
              "Atlanta, the historians and others noted, had only a handful of demonstrations and none were as acrimonious, violent or as transformational as Birmingham or Montgomery.\n",
              "\"Atlanta finishes third,\" Garrow said.\n",
              "Steve Kline, spokesman for the King Center, said a valid argument can be made for Atlanta, as well as Birmingham and Montgomery. He noted the efforts of King’s father to get equal pay for the city’s black teachers a few years before the Montgomery bus boycott. Kline also mentioned the SCLC and that its first meeting was held in Atlanta.\n",
              "\"You could make a good, strong case for Atlanta in some way,\" Kline said.\n",
              "Georgette M. Norman, director of the Rosa Parks Museum in Montgomery, made a slight distinction in the claim for the title.\n",
              "\"We don’t use cradle,\" she said. \"We use birthplace of the modern civil rights movement.\"\n",
              "Norman said the museum makes that distinction because of the efforts made by others toward racial equality in the decades before the bus boycott. In Montgomery, for example, activists like E. D. Nixon had previously been engaged in civil rights efforts there. Nixon helped organized the bus boycott.\n",
              "Norman believes some refer to Birmingham as the cradle of the movement because of the 1963 church bombing. But if she had to choose which city is the \"cradle\"?\n",
              "\"I’d say it’s Montgomery,\" Norman said. \"That became the first sustainable movement and things moved on from there.\"\n",
              "Some say they’ve heard a cradle argument for Greensboro, N.C., where college students staged sit-ins in 1960 to protest not being served at \"whites only\" lunch counters and other locations.\n",

              "Doherty, the former head of the Rhode Island State Police, has said that raising the retirement age of Americans born around 1960 is worth considering. It’s the second part of that sentence that caught PolitiFact’s attention: \"with no regard for the challenges it would cause for people working in physically demanding occupations.\" Had Doherty said that?\n",
              "The flier states as its source an appearance Doherty made on  \"Newsmakers\" on Channel 12 (WPRI) -- though it cites the broadcast date inaccurately. (It says \"3/10/2010.\" The show actually aired March 11, 2012.)\n",
              "Raising the eligibility age of Social Security recipients -- it’s now 67 for those born in 1960 or later  -- has been talked about since at least 2010 when a bipartisan budget commission appointed by President Obama considered it.\n",
              "Mr. Obama created the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform to propose ways to balance the federal budget by 2015. It became known as the Simpson-Bowles commission after its two co-chairmen: former Republican Sen. Alan Simpson, of Wyoming, and Democrat Erskine Bowles, former White House chief of staff under President Bill Clinton.\n",
              "As part of its suggestion to raise the eligibility age, the Simpson-Bowles report specifically calls for a hardship exemption for people who work physically demanding jobs, such as fishermen or construction workers. Their strenuous professions would probably force them to retire by 62, the report says, and they would need retirement income when they do.\n",
              "During the \"Newsmakers\" interview, Doherty is asked a general question about what kinds of changes might people expect in Social Security coverage 10 years from now.\n",
              "Doherty uses the opportunity to first reiterate that he would protect the benefits of seniors and those about to enter the system but  \"down the road we need to look at Social Security .... I  believe there are some good talking points in Simpson-Bowles.\"\n",
              "Doherty is never asked any specific questions about how he feels about hardship exemptions nor does he bring up the issue, a point Ted Nesi , one of the show’s co-hosts, made last week in a blog post.\n",
              "When we asked Cicilline’s campaign for any other evidence of Doherty’s position, campaign manager Eric Hyers said Doherty’s lack of specific mention of the hardship exemptions shows he doesn’t support them and has \"no regard for the challenges\" of those who work in physically demanding jobs.\n",
              "The flier \"is 100 percent accurate,\" Hyers contends.\n",
              "\"He has talked many, many times about raising the age of Social Security,\" said Hyers. \"Never once has he talked about these exemptions. ... If this was a serious concern of his it would have come up.\"\n",
              "Besides, Hyers said, the flier doesn’t actually say Doherty \"opposes an exemption. It only says he has not made a point to speak about it.\"\n",
              "(In fact, the flier says Doherty wants to raise the eligibility raise \"with no regard\" for physically challenging jobs.)\n",
              "We asked the Doherty camp whether their candidate had ever in the past specifically mentioned whether he supported the hardship exemption. Just one reference would undeniably show that the Cicilline campaign was wrong.\n",

              "On March 17, the Missouri House of Representatives narrowly passed and sent House Bill 634 to the Senate to allow for the expansion of charter schools. One legislator who didn’t vote in favor for House Bill 634 was Rep. Nate Walker.\n",
              "The Republican from Kirksville told MissouriNet that Speaker Todd Richardson, R-Poplar Bluff, tried to persuade him to change his mind, but Walker wouldn’t budge. One reason, Walker said, was because \"(charter schools in Missouri) are actually failing in greater capacity than public school systems.\"\n",
              "But are they? Walker didn’t provide a definition for what he meant by failing, and the Missouri education department doesn’t have a specific definition, either. However, after looking at the education department's performance reviews, the data shows that charter schools are performing about the same as nearby public schools.\n",
              "Definitions of failing\n",
              "When PolitiFact called Walker and asked him where he got his data, he said he got it from a \"lot of different things,\" and began providing some numbers.\n",
              "\"Sixty-four percent of Missouri Charter Schools have failed or are failing,\" he said, without citing the source of these statistics. \"Since 1999, we’ve had 59 charter schools open in the state. Thirty-eight of the 59 charter schools have failed or are failing students.\"\n",
              "However, according to the data from the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, for the 2016-17 year there were 72 individual charter schools within 39 charter school districts. And since 1999, the year after charter school law was enacted , there have been 63 charter school districts , and 21 — or 33 percent — have closed.\n",
              "When we asked Walker in a phone interview what his definition was for \"failing,\" this was his response:\n",
              "\"Well, they’re not meeting the standards of the (education department). You go check the facts, I’m not a reporter. You’ve got a degree in journalism and understand factual information, but I stand by my comments, and all you need to do is go do your research and find I’m absolutely right. Probably more than right.\"\n",
              "We went to the education department to learn more. Sarah Potter, the communications coordinator for the department, wrote in an email, \"There are no parameters in state statute for a ‘failing’ charter school.\"\n",
              "However, the department does issue an Annual Performance Review score for both charter and traditional public schools to determine how well they’re educating the students. Charter schools are independent public schools freed from certain regulations. They are also subject to other rules defined by their contracts with their sponsors, such as universities, who then hold charter schools accountable for their results instead of the state.\n",
              "This performance review takes into account standardized test scores, attendance rates and graduation rates along with financial status and leadership stability.\n",
              "There are four levels of accreditation. \"Accredited with Distinction\" and \"Accredited\" signify that the school or district is meeting performance standards. Schools or districts must earn a 70 percent or higher on their performance review to earn those classifications. \"Provisionally Accredited\" and \"Unaccredited\" indicate that the school or district isn’t meeting performance standards and earned a performance review score below 70 percent and below 50 percent, respectively.\n",
              "In fact, in our phone interview with Walker, he did mention accreditation, saying: \"Of the 38 charter schools (districts) currently open for business, 11 have been deemed Provisionally Accredited, six would have been deemed Unaccredited and four were too new to receive a score. Right now 46 percent of the active charter schools would be classified as Accredited.\"\n",
              "These numbers are correct — though there were 39 districts and not 38 as Walker said — according to the latest data available at the state education department’s website .\n",
              "For comparison, 99 percent of traditional public school districts earned Accredited or above while only 46 percent of charter school districts earned that status. It’s not looking so good for Missouri charter schools.\n",
              "Charter schools vs. traditional public schools\n",
              "Not so fast, said Doug Thaman, the executive director of the Missouri Charter Public School Association.\n",
              "\"One of the concerns we have is that when statements are made like (the one) Walker made, that’s a comparison of charter schools to an entire school district, and that is just not a true comparison,\" he said. \"You can’t compare a single school to an entire district or to the entire state.\"\n",
              "What Thaman means is that performance scores are assigned to both individual schools and the districts in which several schools reside, and the scores are often different. He also pointed out that charter schools, which have to accept any student who applies , often educate lower-performing students whose needs haven't been met by traditional public schools, so charter schools score poorly on the performance review because they're helping students who score below grade level catch up.\n",
              "Thaman suggested it would be better to compare the performance score of individual charter schools to individual competitor public schools within the same district. So we did.\n",
              "In Kansas City, the charter schools reside inside public school district Kansas City 33, which had an overall performance score of 70 percent, which is also the lowest score to earn an Accredited or above rating.\n",
              "Both the Kansas City charter schools and traditional public schools in the district had 32 sites that were assigned a performance score in the 2015-16 school year, But more individual charter schools — 21— were performing at or above district’s rate of 70 percent than individual public schools — 12. And even when you compare charter school districts’ performance scores to Kansas City 33’s performance score, over 60 percent of the charter school districts meets or exceeds the district's score.\n",
              "So overall, it appears that most charter schools in Kansas City are doing just fine when compared to Kansas City 33 district and its schools.\n",
              "Now let’s take a look at St. Louis. This one is a little harder to compare because the public school district the charter schools are located within — the St. Louis City district — has 71 sites with performance scores, compared to only 22 charter school sites. St. Louis City district has an overall performance score of 74.6 percent.\n",
              "Just as with Kansas City, it appears that individual St. Louis charter schools are performing about the same as their public school counterparts. Fifty percent of charter schools and 48 percent of public schools earned an Accredited rating, or a 70 percent performance score.\n",
              "However, when comparing districts’ scores, the scales tip toward the public schools. St. Louis City district has an overall score of 74.6 percent. Nine charter school districts, or 56 percent, score below that. However, 57 percent of the traditional public schools fall below their districts’ performance rate., \"(Chris Christie) has not paid one dollar of state money into our pension system, and then states that the system is broke.\" Sen. Loretta Weinberg isn’t shy about attacking Gov. Chris Christie, but when it comes to him not making pension payments, she could show a little patience.\n",
              "The Bergen County Democrat took aim in a recent column on bluejersey.com at the Republican governor’s record of making no payments to the state’s pension funds.\n",
              "\"He has not paid one dollar of state money into our pension system, and then states that the system is broke,\" Weinberg wrote in a Nov. 21 column on the left-leaning blog.\n",
              "PolitiFact New Jersey determined that Weinberg’s claim is technically correct, but still somewhat misleading.\n",
              "The Christie administration has not yet made a pension contribution, but a payment of nearly $500 million is scheduled to be made before the current fiscal year ends in June 2012. That amount represents a fraction of the nearly $3.4 billion needed to fully fund the state’s fiscal year contribution.\n",
              "Even though one is scheduled, Weinberg argued in a phone interview that Christie has not made any pension payments.\n",
              "\"Whether he’ll do it in the future, we’ll see,\" said Weinberg, before referring to her statement. \"I don’t think it’s misleading....It’s a statement of fact.\"\n",
              "Let’s review Christie’s track record with the pension system.\n",
              "In the fiscal year 2011 budget -- Christie’s first spending plan -- the governor did not make any pension contributions, even though a payment of about $3 billion was required to fully fund the state’s share in that fiscal year.\n",
              "But in March 2010, Christie signed a law passed by the Democratic-controlled Legislature, requiring the state to make one-seventh of the full contribution. That policy kicks off with fiscal year 2012, which began in July of this year.\n",
              "The state’s payment is slated to increase by at least an additional one-seventh in each succeeding fiscal year until the full amount is paid in the seventh fiscal year and afterwards.\n",
              "Christie approved a fiscal year 2012 budget that includes that one-seventh payment for a combined contribution of about $484 million to six pension funds. The full contribution would be nearly $3.4 billion.\n",
              "In fact, Weinberg also agreed to make a pension payment by way of voting for the fiscal year 2012 budget.\n",
              "The actual payment will be made at some point during the next seven months in order to use cash on hand, according to Andrew Pratt, a Treasury Department spokesman. Making the pension payment now would likely mean borrowing money, Pratt said.\n",
              "Historically, pension payments are made in the final few weeks of a fiscal year, Pratt told us. Toward the end of a fiscal year, more tax revenue is coming in and most other expenses have been paid, he said.\n",
              "\"It’s a fiscally prudent thing to do,\" Pratt said. \"It’s always better to pay in cash.\"\n",
              "State officials also approved pension and health benefit reform last summer, requiring greater employee contributions toward the benefits. The Christie administration has said the reform would save $120 billion in pension costs over the next 30 years., \"(Deborah) Ross defends those who want to burn the American flag, and even called efforts to ban flag-burning ‘ridiculous,’ yet refused to help a disabled veteran fly the flag.\" Deborah Ross, a former executive director of the North Carolina ACLU, has taken some flak for the positions that group took and legal decisions it made with her at the helm.\n",
              "Now that Ross, a Democrat, is running against Republican Sen. Richard Burr, some of those past decisions are coming up in attack ads targeting her.\n",
              "One ad, released last month by the GOP group Senate Leadership Fund, attempts to paint Ross as unpatriotic.\n",
              "\"Ross defends those who want to burn the American flag, and even called efforts to ban flag-burning ‘ridiculous,’ yet refused to help a disabled veteran fly the flag,\" the ad states.\n",
              "There are three parts to this claim, so we examined each one individually to see how accurate the ad is.\n",
              "Defended flag-burning\n",
              "The first part of the claim is that \"Ross defends those who want to burn the American flag.\"\n",
              "In a way, this is both right and wrong, depending on how someone who hears the ad interprets it. Ross has defended people’s right to burn the flag, although she has said she does not defend the act itself.\n",
              "\"Flag burning is plain wrong, and I’ll stand up for free speech – even speech I don’t like,\" she told McClatchy in an interview last month.\n",
              "Her stance is in keeping with nearly three decades of Supreme Court precedent that Americans cannot be punished by the government for burning the U.S. flag.\n",
              "Doing so is a valid form of protest and free speech that’s protected by the First Amendment, the court ruled in its 1989 case Texas v. Johnson. That 5-4 decision came about in large part thanks to conservative justice Antonin Scalia, who was the swing vote .\n",
              "The 1989 case applied only to Texas, but in 1990 Congress passed a law banning flag-burning – and the Supreme Court then struck it down as unconstitutional, applying the standard nationwide.\n",
              "So Ross did defend flag-burning, taking the side of the Supreme Court.\n",
              "Derided efforts to ban flag-burning\n",
              "Next is the claim that Ross called attempts to ban flag-burning \"ridiculous.\"\n",
              "Seeing as she sided with the Supreme Court precedent on defending flag-burning, it’s not too surprising that this part of the claim is correct as well.\n",
              "\"We have a First Amendment right to burn the flag as symbolic speech,\" Ross said in 1995, while leading the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, regarding a proposal to circumvent the Supreme Court rulings by passing a new constitutional amendment. \"The Constitution protects that right. To spend time and effort on this is ridiculous.\"\n",
              "Refused to help a veteran\n",
              "This is the part that gets tricky.\n",
              "In 2001, a veteran living in Caldwell County wrote the North Carolina ACLU for help in a neighborhood dispute.\n",
              "Robert McClure, a former sergeant in the U.S. Army, had been flying an American flag at his home. But the company that owned the mobile home park where he lived asked him to take it down; a neighborhood covenant said that, among other rules, flag poles weren’t allowed.\n",
              "McClure wrote to the ACLU asking for a lawyer to fight the company and win him the right to fly the flag. The ACLU declined.\n",
              "Ross didn’t personally write the letter declining to take his case, but she was the boss at the time, so the claim seems to be accurate on its face. However, it ignores a few key facts.\n",
              "The Constitution protects people from the government infringing on their rights. It doesn’t apply to interactions with private companies. That’s why you don’t have a First Amendment right to cuss out your boss, and why businesses are allowed to ban firearms on their premises.\n",
              "And McClure was not just trying to bring a constitutional claim against a private company. According to the company, he had actually agreed to the covenants that banned flag poles when he purchased his property.\n",
              "The letter from the ACLU turning him down said that the group received more requests every year than it could possibly handle, and thus \"we can offer legal assistance in only a small number of cases with the maximum possibility of success.\"\n",
              "According to news reports, the veteran’s dispute was nevertheless settled quickly, and he was allowed to fly the flag., \"(Environmentalists) said ‘We’re only going to stop coal mining above 2,000 feet.’ ... Well guess where all the coal in the state of Tennessee is? Above 2,000 feet.\" For years now, state legislators have been arguing over whether to prohibit \"mountaintop coal mining\" in Tennessee and the debate is likely to continue next year since the bill failed again in the 2012 session. In the Legislature's off season, Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey spoke at a rally for coal mining supporters and criticized a central provision of the bill.\n",
              "\"(Environmentalists) said ‘We’re only going to stop coal mining above 2,000 feet.’ ... Well guess where all the coal in the state of Tennessee is? Above 2,000 feet,\" said Ramsey, as quoted by the Kingsport Times-News at the Abingdon, Va., rally in early June.\n",
              "The Senate speaker has made similar comments in other discussions of the bill (SB577), which prohibits that state Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) from issuing any surface coal mining permits on a site above 2,000 feet in elevation.\n",
              "Where did that figure come from?\n",
              "Dawn Coppick, an attorney, who as legislative director of the Lindquist Appalachian Environmental Fellowship (LEAF), helped draft the bill and lobby for passage, says the 2,000-foot level is based on the U.S. Forest Service's classification of \"ecological subregions.\" That amounts to a distinct area, in effect counting as a mountain in Tennessee.\n",
              "Basically, everything above 2,000 feet on the Cumberland Plateau is deemed within such a subregion by the Forest Service and, thus, provides a \"scientifically sound rational basis\" for drawing a line, said Coppick. If the law were passed and challenged in court, judges would look to whether there is a \"rational basis\" for distinguishing one coal-bearing area from another, she said, and the \"ecological subregion\" would meet the legal criteria.\n",
              "The Ramsey remark suggests that the legislation, if passed, would effectively block coal mining in Tennessee because all coal is above 2,000 feet in elevation. Is that accurate?\n",
              "Well, no.\n",
              "Supporters of the bill, opponents of the bill and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation uniformly say there is lots of coal in Tennessee below the 2,000-foot elevation level. And there are maps that show it.. A TDEC map of the state's coal-mining areas with the 2,000-foot elevation marked shows relatively small portions of the overall coal reserves would be included in the proposed ban. LEAF has a map on its website that is more generalized while making the point more clearly to the viewer.\n",
              "But Chuck Laine, president of the Tennessee Mining Association, says there's an underlying basis for Ramsey's comment in that the only marketable coal that can be gathered by surface mining is above 2,000 feet. A ban on mining above 2,000 feet, he contends, would have the practical effect of prohibiting surface mining in Tennessee.\n",
              "Coal is classified in different grades based on BTUs generated when it is burned, sulfur content, PH balance and moisture content.Currently, Laine said, the only marketable coal is that in the higher grades, known as \"thermal coal,\" which meets Environmental Protection Agency specifications for generating electricity in steam plants such as those operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority.\n",
              "\"We couldn't sell our lower-grade coal,\" he said. \"It's just not usable... For higher-grade coal, you have to go above 2,000 feet in Tennessee.\"\n",
              "Coppick, on the other hand, says she knows of no evidence to back up that assertion.\n",
              "Without getting into the merits of the legislation, it still may be appropriate to note the regulatory environment for coal mining in Tennessee. TDEC spokeswoman Meg Lockhart gave this explanation in an email:\n",
              "\"TDEC’s authority at mine sites is limited to regulation of discharges and other impacts to waters, which the department controls through the use of permits issued under Tennessee’s water quality law.\n",
              "The United States Department of Interior, Office of Surface Mining (OSM) issues the permits for the actual coal mining operation. The federal SMCRA permit authorizes the mining of coal as well as the method or type of mining used.\n",
              "\"While OSM does allow mining companies to remove earth to reach coal seams, Tennessee does not allow mine spoil to be deposited in Tennessee streams as some other states do -- regardless of the ridge line elevation. Therefore, mountaintop removal mining is not permitted or practiced in Tennessee as it is in states such as Kentucky and West Virginia.\n",
              "\"Again, Tennessee water quality laws do not allow mining companies to fill valleys with the spoil as it would impair streams. Instead, this waste rock must be stored and returned to its approximate original contour. This mining method is called cross-ridge mining and the correct term for the activity allowed in Tennessee. Additionally, the spoil must be stored while the coal is removed, then replaced and re-vegetated once mining is complete. During this process, ponds must be engineered to capture runoff and control sedimentation.\"\n",
              "At present, TDEC has issued 30 permits for coal mining in the state but about half of them are apparently not in use with coal prices down from levels a few years back. The Knoxville office of OSM, in its annual report last year, listed 15 active Tennessee coal mines – five underground and 10 surface.\n",
              "While no breakdown of mine locations by elevation was available from TDEC, Laine says that all of the surface operations are above 2,000 feet.\n",
              "We invited Ramsey and his staff to defend or elaborate on his statement after explaining that it appears to be mistaken. There was no response.\n",
              "It appears the lieutenant governor has erroneously extrapolated from the coal industry's assertion that there is no marketable coal below the 2,000-foot  elevation to declare there is no coal, marketable or otherwise, below that level in our state., \"(Flint, Mich., is) paying three times more for poison water than I am paying in Burlington, Vt., for clean water.\" Sen. Bernie Sanders said during a Democratic presidential debate in Flint, Mich., that government officials have added insult to injury by charging citizens astronomical utility rates for lead-tainted water.\n",
              "An audience member who lives in Flint asked both Sanders and Democratic primary opponent Hillary Clinton what they would do to help Flint’s residents regain their trust in government. Sanders called the state response \"a disgrace beyond belief\" and said that if he were president, the federal government would take over when a state is incapable of resolving such a crisis. The first place he would start is with dealing with the high price of water.\n",
              "\"What is absolutely incredible to me is that water rates have soared in Flint,\" Sanders said on March 6, 2016 . \"You are paying three times more for poison water than I am paying in Burlington, Vt., for clean water.\"\n",

              "With all the problems with Flint’s water supply, we wondered if it was accurate that Burlington pays one-third the price for service. We learned Flint did indeed have exorbitantly high rates for water that was poisoned with lead, but the numbers have recently dropped from the level Sanders is citing.\n",
              "Rate debate\n",
              "The water crisis emerged after Gov. Rick Snyder appointed an emergency manager to oversee policy decisions in Flint, a majority African-American city ravaged by poverty following a drastic decline in the manufacturing industry.\n",
              "With the power to overrule local officials, then-emergency manager Michael Brown enacted a 35 percent water rate increase to shore up utilities in 2012 (remember this, because we’re coming back to it). Officials opted in April 2013 to stop getting water from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department and join a new pipeline project called the Karegnondi Water Authority.\n",
              "But the pipeline to bring water from Lake Huron wasn’t finished. While the infrastructure was being built, the city began drawing water from the Flint River in April 2014.\n",
              "At this point, it was already apparent water was exceptionally expensive in Flint. In June 2014, the Flint Journal reported that the city charged $35 more per month for water and sewer service than the next-highest rates in Genesee County.\n",
              "The Flint River’s corrosive water leached lead from pipes into the city’s supply. After months of complaints from residents, the national media started exposing the issue in the second half of 2015. (You can read a detailed review in our story here .)\n",
              "We didn’t hear back from the Sanders campaign about his statement. But at least one source has said Flint had the highest residential water rates in the country.\n",
              "Food & Water Watch, an environmental nonprofit that advocates for public utility ownership, surveyed average annual water rates for the 500 largest systems in the United States . They found that in January 2015, Flint’s average water bill was $910 per year .\n",
              "Unfortunately, that doesn’t include Burlington (population 42,000), but we can still compare it to Flint’s 100,000 or so residents by looking at the two city’s water rates.\n",
              "If you’ve ever read your own water bill, you know sussing out how you get charged is a little perplexing. But all you really need to know is that Food & Water Watch came up with their total by measuring the cost of the average household’s annual drinking water use, which is about 60,000 gallons per year. That translates to about 8,021 cubic feet, and utilities often use cubic feet to set their rates.\n",
              "Food & Water Watch also included meter charges that utilities may bill their customers. Flint customers were charged at least $22.90 for a typical home meter, but Burlington Public Works doesn’t charge a meter fee. Both cities’ water departments confirmed the rates we’re using.\n",
              "Just to further complicate things: Do you remember that 35 percent emergency rate increase from 2012? A judge ruled in August 2015 that the increase had to be rolled back because the city misused $15.7 million in water funds to settle a lawsuit. The city also must repay those millions.\n",
              "Because of the relatively recent change, we decided to compare Burlington and Flint both before the judge’s ruling and after:\n",
              "Flint’s residential water rates used to essentially be twice Burlington’s at the start of 2015, but were about 55 percent higher after the judge ruled the rates rolled back. Neither one of those figures is three times as much as Burlington, like Sanders said.\n",
              "But that hefty meter fee makes a big difference. We’re including it because you had to pay it if your house in Flint had water service, raising your bill significantly.\n",
              "When we look at average annual bills from January 2015, Sanders’ 3-to-1 comparison is pretty close. But after August, Flint customers were paying a little more than twice as much as Burlington residents., \"(For) white working-class America, death rates among white men are up 20 percent.\" President Donald Trump’s supporters continue to back him because they felt so besieged by the political landscape and life in general that it’s literally killing them, a GOP strategist said on ABC’s This Week.\n",
              "Alex Castellanos, who has worked as a consultant for George W. Bush and Mitt Romney, said during an Aug. 20, 2017, discussion on the show that Trump’s backers have stuck with him through controversies because they didn’t see an alternative option. Democrats attacking Trump’s response to violence in Charlottesville, Va., just fed into growing bitterness among his base over their dire socioeconomic situation, he said.\n",
              "\"What I think a lot of Trump supporters heard this week was, the Democrats are just painting us, Trump supporters, with a Nazi brush. We're all white supremacists. That's their excuse for why they lost the election,\" Castellanos said. \"No. White working-class America, death rates among white men are up 20 percent. They're unemployed. Gwen Ifill said, ‘no wonder they're resentful.’\"\n",
              "We wondered about his statistic that working-class white men are dying at a higher rate than before. It turns out that researchers have identified increasing mortality among the white working class, but it’s not as high for men as the 20 percent number Castellanos cited.\n",
              "Increased mortality rates\n",
              "In response to our questions, Castellanos sent us two articles from the  New York Times and the  Guardian  about a 2015 paper by husband-and-wife Princeton economists Angus Deaton and Anne Case. Their research showed that death rates for middle-aged, white Americans had been going up, while they had been going down for every other age, race and ethnic group. Those rates also had been falling in other countries.\n",
              "This was a reversal of a years-long trend in which mortality rates had been steadily decreasing, meaning that Americans across many groups were living longer. From 1978 to 1998, white Americans were seeing mortality rates fall about 2 percent each year. So the fact that Case and Deaton found an increase was considered significant.\n",
              "But Deaton told us the 20 percent number Castellanos cited for men was too high. (That’s a number the Guardian reported, but it cites the increase as being for \"the death rate for white Americans aged 45 to 54.\")\n",
              "\"In our 2015 PNAS paper, we say that for all white non-Hispanics (men and women together), mortality rates for those aged 45 to 54 rose at half of one percent per year, which from 1998 to 2013 is 7.8 percent, not 20 percent, and certainly not 20 percent for men only,\" Deaton wrote via email. Case added that that was for all levels of education, not just people who didn’t have a college degree.\n",
              "Deaton and Case’s study showed that mortality rates were climbing for white, non-Hispanic Americans aged 45 to 54 with a high school education or less. The research further showed that deaths were up from drug and alcohol poisonings, suicides, chronic liver diseases and cirrhosis. Mortality rates rose for all education groups, but \"those with less education saw the most marked increases,\" the paper read.\n",
              "It’s important to note that overall mortality rates for African-Americans were still higher than whites. But African-Americans still recorded an overall drop in the same time period, not an increase.\n",
              "Researchers were surprised by the Case and Deaton study in 2015. Dartmouth economists Ellen Meara and Jonathan Skinner said in an analysis that while most Americans’ life expectancies had gone up in the face of the Great Recession and rising income inequality, the study’s findings \"dashed even this cautiously optimistic view of the past several decades.\"\n",
              "\"These trends are indeed concentrated among the least educated Americans who never attended college,\" Meara told PolitiFact. \"Of note, the trends do not apply to current retirees, nor youth, both groups that have experienced mortality improvements in recent decades.\"\n",
              "Others questioned the paper’s results . Columbia University statistics professor Andrew Gelman argued that the situation wasn’t as dire as it first appeared . He said that some statistical adjustments showed that middle-aged white women largely made up the difference in mortality rates, and the figures evened out when you combined men and women.\n",
              "Deaton and Case addressed some of these doubts in a 2017 follow-up to their paper . While the 2015 data didn’t focus on differences between men and women, their latest work did, along with adjusting their age groups.\n",
              "\"For non-Hispanic white men aged 30 to 59 without a four-year college degree, age-adjusted all-cause mortality rose by 7 percent from 1998 to 2015,\" Deaton said of the latest data.\n",
              "Again they found that a lack of education was a major factor for increasing mortality rates, among other issues. (Gelman and Jonathan Auerbach, a Columbia doctoral student, again disputed their findings .)\n",
              "\"We propose a preliminary but plausible story in which cumulative disadvantage from one birth cohort to the next, in the labor market, in marriage and child outcomes, and in health, is triggered by progressively worsening labor market opportunities at the time of entry for whites with low levels of education,\" the 2017 paper read.\n",
              "There’s evidence that whites with less education on the lower end of the income spectrum didn’t make up the bulk of Trump’s voters. The Washington Post reported that his base is largely affluent Republicans , whether they have a college education or not.\n",
              "Deaton said Castellanos was speaking too broadly, and the spirit of his comment misses what the research really says.\n",

But Kaegi only saw profits.\" Berrios also aired a similarly worded radio ad .\n",
              "The for-profit prison industry has long been the focus of animus for Democrats nationally, and the very concept of private prisons has been a source of controversy generally, so connecting Kaegi to it could score political points for Berrios.\n",
              "Investment funds like those managed by Kaegi contain dozens of stocks covering a diverse array of industries. We took a look to see if private prisons were in the portfolio on Kaegi’s watch.\n",
              "Timeline trouble\n",
              "Kaegi spent 13 years as an investment manager at Columbia Wanger Asset Management, where he oversaw the Columbia Acorn Fund with two other analysts. He gave up management duties of the fund and left Columbia Wanger on March 13 to begin his campaign.\n",
              "Our first call was to the Berrios campaign to find out the basis for the ad’s allegation. Campaign spokeswoman Monica Trevino provided a quarterly Securities and Exchange Commission filing from March 31 that showed the Columbia Acorn Fund contained 926,513 shares in CoreCivic , a Nashville-based company that manages 91 prisons and related facilities across the country. The shares are valued at $29,111,038, according to the filing.\n",
              "Trevino also sent an amendment to the Columbia Acorn prospectus dated March 13 that showed Kaegi’s oversight of the fund would end on March 14. Because the quarterly report includes time when Kaegi was one of three managers of the fund, he’s connected to the CoreCivic investment, Trevino said.\n",
              "\"Kaegi has not (provided) any definitive evidence that when the investment was made he wasn’t there,\" Trevino said in an email.\n",
              "Virtual paper trail\n",
              "Interestingly, Kaegi provided the same March 13 document in defending himself. He said it shows he was not active in the fund’s management after that date and that CoreCivic and other stocks were added to the portfolio between March 14 and March 31.\n",
              "Kaegi explained he ran the fund with two other managers — lead portfolio manager Matthew A. Litfin and co-manager P. Zachary Egan — and no investments were made without agreement from all three.\n",
              "\"If one person was against buying, you didn’t buy,\" Kaegi said. Kaegi consistently had blocked investment in CoreCivic and a few other stocks, but that ended when he stepped down as manager on March 13, he said. Neither Litfin nor Egan responded to our requests for comment.\n",
              "\"I always thought these were bad companies\" that \"try to dress themselves up as real estate companies,\" said Kaegi, adding that he believes changing attitudes on mass incarceration make private prison stocks a risky investment. That’s in addition to ethical concerns over privatizing correctional facilities, he said.\n",
              "In a press release issued shortly after Berrios’ ad appeared, Kaegi’s campaign provided links to all of the fund’s quarterly reports from 2015 and 2016, none of which show CoreCivic (or Corrections Corporation of America, as it previously had been known) among its holdings.\n",
              "Kaegi also produced a summary from Feb. 28, 2017 — just two weeks before his management ended — that does not show CoreCivic among Columbia Acorn Fund’s holdings.\n",
              "\"This is just about the most controversial stock you can imagine,\" Kaegi said. \"Why on earth would I do that when I’m about to step down to run for this office?\"\n",
              "A comparison of the Feb. 28 summary and the March 31 quarterly report shows several stocks — Bioverativ, Blackline, Brunswick Corp., Copart, CoreCivic, Credit Acceptance Corp., Pool Corp., Q2, Tractor Supply and TransUnion — that were added after Feb. 28. Kaegi campaign spokesman DeRondal Bevly said TransUnion was the only stock that was added while Kaegi still managed the fund., \"(GM and Chrysler) repaid their loans.\" A new Barack Obama campaign video narrated by Tom Hanks portrays the president’s bailout of General Motors and Chrysler as courageous and successful — with loans repaid by car companies.\n",
              "\"Because of the tough choices the president made, the stage was set for a resurgent U.S. auto industry,\" Hanks says in the 17-minute highlights reel of Obama’s presidency, titled The Road We’ve Traveled.\n",
              "\"With business booming, (GM and Chrysler) repaid their loans,\" he later concludes.\n",
              "It’s a claim we’ve heard before from the CEOs of GM and Chrysler in 2010 and 2011. At the time, we rated their claims Half True .\n",
              "But it’s been months since we’ve looked at this question, so we thought we’d ask again.\n",
              "We’re not checking the overall merit of the government’s efforts to support the car companies, which relies on opinion. Instead, we’re checking some of the facts marshaled by filmmakers. In another item, we checked whether auto bailout money had run out by the time Obama took office. We rated that Mostly True . And here we’ll check whether GM and Chrysler \"repaid their loans\" from U.S. taxpayers.\n",
              "The bailouts\n",
              "We reached out to the car companies, consulted a detailed accounting of Bush and Obama administration rescues kept by the Pulitzer-winning ProPublica , consulted the U.S. Treasury and reviewed other reports and fact-checks on this topic.\n",
              "The story begins in late 2008, when the U.S. economy was crashing. By early December, GM and Chrysler told the government they couldn’t get the credit they needed to survive, threatening more than 1 million jobs, according to a report from the Congressional Oversight Panel .\n",
              "President George W. Bush’s administration provided the auto companies with short-term funding from the Troubled Asset Relief Program — remember TARP? — support that was continued under Obama with additional loans that financed the companies’ bankruptcy reorganizations.\n",
              "The 2009 report predicted , \"Although taxpayers may recover some portion of their investment in Chrysler and GM, it is unlikely they will recover the entire amount.\" In September 2011, the Treasury reported that it expected the auto bailouts to \"cost the taxpayer just under $24 billion.\"\n",
              "How does this square with the statement that the companies have \"repaid their loans\"?\n",
              "Some government money was offered as loans — but much more was used to purchase stock. Meanwhile, during restructuring, GM and Chrysler were divided into \"old\" and \"new\" companies. And the car companies' consumer finance arms also received aid in the effort to avoid shutdowns.\n",
              "Our tally of ProPublica’s work on General Motors , GMAC , Chrysler and Chrysler Financial Services shows that of $80 billion spent by taxpayers on the entire bailout, we’re still waiting on nearly $40 billion, a number confirmed by the Treasury Department. At some point, selling taxpayers’ stock in GM and GMAC may earn back a chunk of the rest. But all of it? The story’s not over yet.\n",
              "What part of that was loans? Let's look at each automaker.\n",
              "Chrysler\n",
              "The government’s bailout of \"Chrysler\" actually involved government infusions totaling more than $12 billion to three companies. One was the automaker prior to its bankruptcy reorganization, the old Chrysler. One was the reorganized company, Chrysler Group. And the third was the company that provided consumer auto loans, Chrysler Financial Services.\n",
              "Just two of the three have satisfied their government obligations. But the film's \"repaid\" rhetoric reflects solely the Chrysler Group — the new Chrysler. What’s the larger story?\n",
              "• Since Chrysler Group LLC was formed in June 2009, it has repaid its U.S. loans of $5.1 billion \"in full, with interest, six years early,\" according to a fact-sheet from Katie Merx, financial communications manager for the reorganized company.  (The Treasury also says so .) Another chunk of money bought the government a small ownership stake in the new company, but that’s already been bought by Fiat . So, the Chrysler Group, the entity that arose out of the bankruptcy, has repaid its loans and has shed government ownership.\n",
              "• Chrysler Financial Services, now TD Auto Finance , has paid off its loan of $1.5 billion — and taxpayers made $22 million on the deal, according to the Treasury Department and ProPublica.\n",
              "• But the amount taxpayers loaned to Chrysler before it filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009 — the entity now dubbed \"Old Carco\" — was chalked up as a loss by the federal government. That’s a $1.3 billion loan that will never be repaid. (The old company is still grinding through liquidation, but the government doesn’t expect to collect any more.)\n",
              "So, new Chrysler has \"repaid its loans,\" as has Chrysler Financial Services. But old Chrysler was lent $1.3 billion that won’t be repaid. Even so, taxpayers have fared better than most folks thought — a government official suggested in 2009 that $7 billion might be lost.\n",
              "Instead, most taxpayer money has been restored, and the new company says it has added more than 9,000 jobs.\n",
              "General Motors\n",
              "GM’s story is even more dramatic.\n",
              "Its $67 billion bailout also involved three companies, the old GM, the GM that emerged out of bankruptcy reorganization and auto financing arm GMAC, which is now Ally Financial.\n",
              "• The new company received $6.7 billion in secured loans. In April 2010, GM repaid them with interest — and touted it had \" repaid our government loan, in full, with interest, five years ahead of the original schedule .\" But billions of dollars more had been converted to a 61 percent stake in the new company, said James Cain, financial news manager for GM. That stake is now down to 32 percent of the company’s common stock. The question is how much that stock will earn taxpayers to offset $27 billion not yet recouped from old and new GM. A third of GM’s entire stock value as of March 19, 2012, was just $13 billion. (Check its current market capitalization .)\n",
              "• The former GMAC still has substantial government ownership – more than 70 percent of its common stock is held by taxpayers, according to the Treasury Department — but no loans. According to ProPublica, there’s more than $11 billion left on the GMAC ledger . So it’s not yet clear how taxpayers will fare.\n",
              "• Old GM got nearly $1 billion in loans, and the Treasury Department has so far squeezed $136 million out of the company as it is liquidated in bankruptcy court. But it’s not clear how much taxpayers will ultimately recoup.\n",
              "GM has certainly used the reboot to roar back into the marketplace. Its sales, along with those of its Chinese affiliates, were No. 1 in the world in 2011 . (Aided the fact that its main competitor, Toyota, grappled with an earthquake, tsunami and floods.) But we’re not measuring the bailout’s success — merely the question of loan repayment.\n",
              "As with Chrysler, new GM has repaid its \"loans,\" while old GM may fail to repay $850 million. Unlike Chrysler, the government still owns a third of GM and more than 70 percent of the former GMAC — stock that taxpayers can hope will one day earn enough to make them whole., \"(George) LeMieux never requested a single earmark and pushed to ban them all.\" A new Web ad from the campaign for former Sen. George LeMieux claims there's a big difference between him and Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson on the issue of earmarks.\n",
              "A narrator in the ad, called \" The Choice ,\" says, \"Nelson voted for billions in wasteful spending earmarks like the Bridge to Nowhere. LeMieux never requested a single earmark and pushed to ban them all.\"\n",
              "We broke this claim into two fact-checks. In a separate item , we explore the claim that, \"Nelson voted for billions in wasteful spending earmarks like the Bridge to Nowhere. \" In this item, we will address the second half of the equation, the claim that, \"LeMieux never requested a single earmark and pushed to ban them all.\"\n",
              "While this is technically true, the contrast isn't as black-and-white as the ad suggests.\n",
              "Here's why:\n",
              "LeMieux was appointed to the Senate by then-Florida Gov. Charlie Crist to fill the remaining term of retiring Sen. Mel Martinez. LeMieux took office on Sept. 10, 2009, and served until Jan. 3, 2011.\n",
              "Soon after taking office, LeMieux voted in favor of a handful of appropriations bills that included thousands of earmarks worth billions of dollars.\n",
              "We'll break it down.\n",
              "On Oct. 15, 2009, LeMieux voted in favor of an appropriations bill for energy and water development and related agencies for the 2010 fiscal year. According to a Congressional Research Service report , the bill included 2,293 earmarks at a cost of $5.7 billion.\n",
              "On Oct. 6, 2009, and Dec. 19, 2009, LeMieux voted in favor of appropriations bills for the Department of Defense . They included 1,719 earmarks at a cost of $4.2 billion.\n",
              "On Oct. 20, 2009, LeMieux voted in favor of an appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security . It included 192 earmarks at a cost of $420 million.\n",
              "On Nov. 5, 2009, LeMieux voted in favor of an appropriations bill for Commerce, Justice, Science and related agencies. The bill included 1,513 earmarks at a cost of $781 million.\n",
              "On Nov. 17, LeMieux voted in favor of an appropriations bill for military construction and veterans affairs . It included 745 earmarks at a cost of $14.5 billion.\n",
              "In other words, LeMieux voted for bills containing billions of dollars in earmarks, the very thing the ad criticized Nelson for in the previous sentence.\n",
              "But the ad is artfully worded. It doesn't say LeMieux never voted for an earmark, it says he never requested a single one.\n",
              "That's true, but it's also true that earmarks bound for Florida were already packed into the appropriations bills before LeMieux took over for Martinez. We checked the earmark database for the 2010 fiscal year compiled by Taxpayers for Common Sense -- a group that tracks federal earmarks -- and found several dozen earmarks at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars requested by Martinez (sometimes jointly requested with Nelson and others) for various Florida projects, which were included in the appropriations bills that LeMieux voted for. We didn't find any evidence that LeMieux tried to remove those Florida earmarks.\n",
              "We asked LeMieux about those votes via e-mail.\n",
              "\"I never requested an earmark,\" LeMieux said. \"It became clear to me after my first couple months in D.C., and those first appropriation bills, that earmarks are the engine that drive the train of increased spending. After that experience I had a press conference with Sens. DeMint, Graham and others pledging not to seek an earmark.\"\n",
              "In that press conference, the Republican legislators called for a one-year moratorium on all earmarks.\n",
              "\"Let me tell you why I think earmarks are a problem,\" LeMieux said at the press conference. \"They're not just a problem for the amount of the budget that they are, because it's not a huge amount. They are a problem because they are the enabler.\n",
              "\"In my short time here, I have seen that if you ask for a project and you bring it back for your home state, then when the budget that they bring before you on a particular appropriations bill is 10 percent, 15 percent, 20 percent, 25 percent more than last year, you can't vote against it or you'll never get another project again. So I haven't done earmarks since I've been here, and I made a decision last month not to do them for the rest of the time I'm here, because the nation is in dire financial straits.\"\n",
              "So there's no question LeMieux pushed to ban earmarks, as the ad claims. But to back up that point, the ad cites LeMieux's vote on Nov. 30, 2010, in favor of an amendment that sought to establish a moratorium on earmarks through the 2013 fiscal year. The amendment failed with 39 senators voting in favor (including LeMieux) and 56 against. But here's what the ad doesn't say: Nelson also voted for the moratorium.\n",
              "\"Sen. Nelson may have voted to ban all earmarks, but he still sought them and still supports them,\" LeMieux wrote to us in an e-mail. \"My vote was sincere.\"\n",
              "Also, LeMieux stated, \"I have signed a pledge not to seek any earmarks if I have the honor of serving again.\"\n",
              "We contacted Nelson's press office for comment but did not hear back.\n",
              "Again, the wording of the earmark claims in LeMieux's ad are technically true. LeMieux has not personally requested any earmarks, and he has pushed to ban them all. But we think it's a bit hypocritical for LeMieux to call out Nelson for voting for a bill that included billions of dollars worth of earmarks (and specifically the infamous Bridge to Nowhere).\n",
              "LeMieux also voted for bills that included thousands of earmarks worth billions of dollars. By the same logic in LeMieux's ad, Nelson could counter with an ad that says LeMieux voted for billions in earmarks including any number of outrageous-sounding pet projects from around the country that were included in the handful of appropriations bills LeMieux voted for in late 2009.\n",
              "LeMieux makes the distinction that he never personally requested earmarks (while Nelson certainly has). But again, we think it's worth noting that the appropriations bills LeMieux voted in favor of were stuffed with dozens of Florida earmarks -- costing hundreds of millions of dollars -- that were requested by his Republican predecessor, Martinez. LeMieux has put himself out front on the issue of reining in earmarks, taking a stand early in 2010 calling for a complete ban. And LeMieux may not buy that Nelson has found religion on earmarks, but Nelson was among only a half dozen Democrats in the Senate who also voted for the earmark moratorium., \"(George) Soros Provides Migrants With Prepaid Debit Cards To Fund Illegal Journeys\" Conservative bloggers have been working overtime to link liberal philanthropist George Soros with the thousands of Hondurans who have left the country and are trying to get to the United States.\n",
              "Once such attempt, with headlines such as \"Soros Provides Migrants With Prepaid Debit Cards To Fund Illegal Journeys,\" was posted on News Punch Nov. 5.\n",
              "But the story doesn't talk about the Honduran migrants. Instead, it says that Soros has been helping out migrants coming to Europe from Syria and other countries.\n",
              "\"The European migrant crisis is being fueled by free cash handouts from the United Nations, European Union and George Soros’ Open Society Foundations, according to bombshell information from Europe which suggests the UN, EU and Soros are luring illegal migrants to the continent with money,\" News Punch says.\n",
              "The story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook .)\n",
              "The \"bombshell information\" link sends readers to a Slovenian website called nova24tv.si and an Oct. 30 story expresses alarm over Muslim migrants coming into Europe. It questions where the migrants are getting their money and focuses on prepaid debit cards that carry the MasterCard logo and have been given to migrants. The Nova24TV story says they are paid for by the U.N.'s World Food Program.\n",
              "But there's no mention of Soros as a source of the cards. Instead, the Nova24TV story asks, \"Does the EU, directly with taxpayers' money, finance the violence that the Islamic invasion brings with it to European countries?\"\n",
              "The blue cards carry the logo of The UN Refugee Agency and a case study evaluating how well the card was helping refugees, found on the ReliefWeb.int website, doesn't mention Soros or a Soros organization.\n",
              "So why is Soros being pegged with providing these cards?\n",
              "Nearly two years ago, Soros and Mastercard announced \"plans to explore creating a social enterprise to apply commercial strategies to deliver a positive impact on society. Called Humanity Ventures, the enterprise could catalyze and accelerate economic and social development for vulnerable communities around the world, especially refugees and migrants.\"\n",
              "The Jan. 19, 2017 news release isn't specific about what programs Soros' Humanity Ventures would try, but the bloggers are making the connection without offering any evidence.\n",
              "In fact, it's clear from the \"bombshell\" source News Punch is citing that by time the Soros-Mastercard agreement was announced, the UN Refugee Agency prepaid debit cards had been around for at least four years.\n",
              "The Nova24TV story says that a Mastercard website was reporting that 300,000 people in places like Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt had received the cards by the end of 2013 and Mastercard \"wanted to distribute 2.5 million such cards to be used in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey\" by the end of 2014.\n",
              "The website Inside Philanthropy reported shortly after the announcement that Humanity Ventures, a for-profit organization, \"plans to combine existing global health and development solutions to expand access to healthcare and education, as well as to improve local economic development and entrepreneurship. An additional goal of the organization is to improve the delivery of humanitarian aid.\"\n",
              "So has the Soros initiative included adding money to some of those prepaid Mastercards to migrants in Europe?\n",
              "Soros spokesman Michael Vachon said in an email the claim is false.\n",
              "MasterCard and the philanthropist \"have been in discussions about joint investment opportunities,\" he said. \"None has reached fruition so far.\"\n",
              "Without that connection, this debit card claim is overdrawn., \"(Hillary Clinton's State Department) actually admonished one of her ambassadors because he wasn’t using the proper server.\" Hillary Clinton, already facing a congressional inquiry about the personal email account she used as secretary of state, could be facing another federal investigation by President Barack Obama’s Justice Department.\n",
              "Appearing on Fox News Sunday, Republican presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky called the Justice Department’s potential review into whether classified information was mishandled \"damning\" before charging Clinton with hypocrisy.\n",
              "\"Even she knew there was a rule,\" Paul said July 26 . \"They actually admonished one of her ambassadors because he wasn't using the proper server. I don't understand how she can skate by and act as if she wasn't aware of the law.\"\n",
              "We won’t address here whether Clinton was or wasn’t \"aware of the law.\" But we were curious about Paul’s allegation: Did the State Department under Clinton chide a diplomat for handling email on an improper server in the same way as Clinton?\n",
              "The Clinton campaign declined to comment.\n",
              "The ambassador\n",
              "A spokeswoman for Paul told us he was referring to Scott Gration, a former Obama advisor who left his post as ambassador to Kenya three years ago.\n",
              "After less than a year and half on the job, Gration resigned in June 2012 (while Clinton was secretary) after reading a draft of a highly critical audit by the State Department’s Office of the Inspector General, which works independently . Among Gration’s many failings was his continued usage of a personal email account, according to the report.\n",
              "Unsurprisingly, Gration’s drama resurfaced when the Clinton email controversy first erupted in March 2015, and some claimed that Gration was fired for his \" Hillary-like\" use of the email . (Gration used a Gmail account.) Gration himself called the State Department’s treatment of him a double standard.\n",
              "PunditFact, however, found that most of the reports inflated the significance of the personal email. Gration’s grating style of management, uncooperative attitude and \"disruptive\" initiatives were more pressing to the State Department. Out of more than 80 mission chiefs, he ranked last for interpersonal relations, next to last on managerial skill and attention to morale, and third to last on overall scores, according to the audit.\n",
              "Compared to these issues, the email problem played a minor role, according to Ronald Neumann, who served as an American ambassador three times, most recently in Afghanistan from 2005-07.\n",
              "\"It could be an important issue, but when you screw up as many things as this guy did, it’s hard to get through to that one,\" Neumann told PunditFact .\n",
              "The admonishment\n",
              "Paul’s claim, however, is more tempered, and thus more accurate. That audit did indeed \"admonish\" Gration for his email habits. The fourth bullet point on the report’s summary reads:\n",
              "\"The Ambassador’s greatest weakness is his reluctance to accept clear-cut U.S. Government decisions. He made clear his disagreement with Washington policy decisions and directives concerning the safe-havening in Nairobi of families of Department employees who volunteered to serve in extreme hardship posts; the creation of a freestanding Somalia Unit; and the nonuse of commercial email for official government business, including Sensitive But Unclassified information. Notwithstanding his talk about the importance of mission staff doing the right thing, the Ambassador by deed or word has encouraged it to do the opposite.\"\n",
              "The report describes Gration’s actions in detail starting on page 43 : He deliberately defied the State Department’s rule on communication by installing a commercial Internet connection in his embassy office bathroom and authorizing his embassy staff to use personal emails.\n",
              "\"He has willfully disregarded Department regulations on the use of commercial email for official government business,\" the report says .\n",
              "Ars Technica , a technology news site, put it even more bluntly: \"Gration was the end user from hell for an understaffed IT team in a politically sensitive outpost.\"\n",
              "The report also spells out the reasons for the policy: Unauthorized systems increase the risk for hacks and loss of records. It then states that the use of personal emails \"must be limited to maintaining communications during emergencies\" and recommended the embassy stop using the unofficial email accounts.\n",
              "It is unclear if top State Department brass slammed Gration for violating the personal email policy, as Paul suggests. We found no on-the-record condemnations from department officials, though Gration said multiple times that Clinton’s chief of staff fired him after reading the report. An audit by an inspector general is different than Clinton directly criticizing Gration for the practice.\n",
              "Comparison to Clinton\n",
              "In short, the department’s watchdogs chided Gration for a number of issues, including his personal email use. But how closely did his improper email habits mirror Clinton’s?\n",
              "Clinton exclusively used a personal email account during her tenure as the country’s top diplomat. At the time, there was no law prohibiting the practice (one was put in place in 2014). There was, however, a long-standing policy against using personal emails, reiterated in a 2011 memo from the State Department under Clinton. Gration, for his part, used both, although he \"very infrequently\" logged onto his classified account, the report says.\n",
              "Without more information, it’s hard to compare the security risks of both setups. Gration likely channeled his personal emails through an unsecured Internet connection despite repeated warnings, according to the  Washington Post .\n",
              "As for Clinton, her personal email was relayed through a private server guarded by the Secret Service, Clinton said at a March press conference . We don’t know if the State Department signed off on her private server, but it was aware of the server’s existence. The emails were encrypted after March 2009, according to her security provider , though there’s still debate over the account’s security.\n",
              "Overall, an expert told us it’s an apples-to-apples comparison, though he cautioned that the inspector general report does not address why Gration was using a personal email. ( According to Gration, he couldn’t get news alerts through the official State Department server.)\n",
              "\"The similarities between the two situations are striking, and it is fair to compare them,\" said Douglas Cox, a law professor at the City University of New York, who studies records preservation. \"Both were in senior leadership positions. Both made a regrettable decision to use non-official email, which raised security and record-keeping concerns that should have been obvious. And both refused to accept that their continuous use of non-official email violated State Department rules.\"\n",
              "Cox pointed out that the report condemned Gration’s email usage as a failure in leadership that \"sapped the morale\" of his staff. The same criticism could apply to Clinton, who, as secretary of state, should be held to a higher standard than Gration, Cox argued.\n",
              "\"The buck should have stopped with her, and she should have been leading by example,\" he said., \"(I) helped to invent a system that saved over a billion dollars on welfare.\" In a television commercial, Kenneth Block, the Moderate Party candidate for governor, tries to appeal to voters by suggesting that he is business savvy, concerned about the environment, and knows how to save taxpayer money.\n",
              "\"I built a successful high-tech business, created green jobs, and helped to invent a system that saved over a billion dollars on welfare,\" he says in the commercial, which is also available on his website .\n",
              "We decided to focus on the welfare claim and the savings Block says he helped to generate.\n",
              "First, Block isn't talking about Rhode Island. He said he is talking about software he helped develop for Texas, which in 1995 adopted a statewide debit card system for food stamp and welfare recipients. It computerized every transaction, eliminating, for example, the need for paper food stamps, which can be stolen or misused.\n",
              "He's been more specific on his website blog : \"As a small business owner, Ken helped to invent a system that saved Texas over a billion dollars on welfare. He did this by eliminating waste and fraud in the system . . . \"\n",
              "Second, the $1 billion savings estimate comes from food stamps, not from welfare, which people often lump together because both are forms of public assistance. Block's campaign encouraged us to focus on the food stamp program because, they said, it would be easier to quantify the savings.\n",
              "How did Block's efforts help save this money? He said one technique is \"data mining,\" in which large amounts of information are analyzed to look for improprieties, such as a small grocery that reports the food sales numbers of a huge supermarket. He said sham storefronts were paying food stamp recipients 50 cents on the dollar for their stamps and then billing the state for the full amount when no food was actually sold. Such information helped direct investigators to crooked vendors and recipients, he said.\n",
              "So there are two key questions: Did Block help create the fraud detection system and did it save $1 billion?\n",
              "Geoffrey Wool, a spokesman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, said Block was an employee of GTECH when Texas contracted with the Rhode Island gambling company in the early 1990s to develop the EBT system. Wool said the Texas commission currently gets services from Simpatico Software Systems, the company Block started after he left GTECH.\n",
              "Block also referred us to Curtis Ermer, one of his GTECH colleagues on the EBT project.\n",
              "\"Ken's role was large in terms of the design. Ken could sit down in a short period of time and optimize that code,\" said Ermer, who has since left GTECH. He said an anti-fraud component \"was a purpose of the whole EBT system. The counterfeiting of stamps, the multiple addresses people would use, was supposed to be reduced.\"\n",
              "Thus, it appears Block played a significant role in establishing the EBT system, so his \"helped to invent\" claim is True.\n",
              "What about the second key question: Did that system save more than $1 billion?\n",
              "We were unable to locate any official report showing how much waste or fraud was eliminated by adoption of the EBT program. Block's campaign then directed us to several news reports from 1998 suggesting that the savings were large, although they widely disagreed on the amount saved:\n",
              "* In an opinion piece in The Houston Chronicle, Joe Williams, president of the Gulf Coast Retailers Association, said the number of Texas households receiving food stamps and welfare benefits plummeted from 1.4 million in 1994 to 850,000 in 1998 due to the EBT card system, saving taxpayers more than $1.2 billion a year.\n",
              "* A Dallas Morning News story quoted then-Texas Comptroller John Sharp as saying there had been a 250,000-person decline in food stamp rolls. At the time, a typical recipient was receiving about $70 in food stamps per month, according to a federal report we located independently. That would translate to a savings of $206 million per year.\n",
              "*A San Antonio Express-News story quoted Sharp's office as reporting that the decline in food stamp enrollment saved $67.3 million a month. That would total more than $800 million in just one year.\n",
              "The Block campaign also directed us to a March 1996 state newsletter , quoting Sharp as saying that when EBT went on-line in Houston in February 1995, 30,000 recipients immediately dropped off the food stamp rolls, including some who had been receiving food stamps at two or three different addresses.\n",
              "It also reported that \"between January and October 1995, Texas' food stamp rolls shrank by nearly 200,000 recipients.\" At $70 per month per person, the statewide savings would surpass $1 billion after six years and one month -- sooner if you factor in inflation.\n",
              "All of this suggests that the EBT system indeed saved a lot of money in Texas.\n",
              "But there were some dissenting voices.\n",
              "We talked to Celia Hagert, a senior policy analyst for the Center for Public Policy Priorities, an Austin-based nonprofit think tank devoted to improving the economic and social conditions of low- and moderate-income Texans. She agreed that the card system eliminated fraud on the part of retailers, but said enrollment was declining before the card system went into effect and \"there weren't hordes and hordes of people fraudulently receiving food stamps.\"\n",
              "And two officials at the Texas Health and Human Services Commission insisted that GTECH, Block and his company have had no direct role in fraud detection.\n",
              "\"There is no fraud detection mechanism in the product GTECH delivered,\" said Wool, the commission's spokesman. Instead, Wool said, the system simply sends data to Texas' Office of Inspector General, which developed its own fraud detection software.\n",
              "Block responded by showing us two emails from Douglas B. Walker, of Austin, who was a system analyst for the Texas Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) system, retiring in 2007. The messages asked Block to look into some cases of suspected fraud.\n",
              "So we asked Wool to put us in touch with someone higher. He arranged an interview with Michael Garbarino, director of policy and outreach affairs for the inspector general's office, who expressed surprise at the Walker emails, saying he had talked to others to confirm that making such checks was not an assigned function.\n",
              "\"None of these contracts, none of the vendors, nor any of the subcontractors ever had within the scope of the contract fraud detection responsibilities,\" he said. \"The automation that runs that data through algorithms to arrive at questionable transactions was entirely created by state staff and never was in the scope of any vendor contract.\"\n",
              "In the end, Block did help develop the EBT system and the system likely saved -- directly or indirectly -- more than $1 billion in waste and fraud since its implementation 15 years ago., \"(Jack Kingston) had more earmarks at one time than every member of the Georgia delegation put together.\" For years, pork was the preferred meat of Congress.\n",
              "Lawmakers pulled money from the federal budget for various projects in their congressional districts without having to compete in the open bidding system of the federal departments. Critics derisively called the process pork. The official term was \"earmarks.\"\n",
              "Congress voted to abstain from pork in 2010, but one candidate is attempting to make it an issue in one of Georgia’s most interesting political races.\n",
              "\"(Jack Kingston) had more earmarks at one time than every member of the Georgia delegation put together,\" U.S. Rep. Paul Broun, an Athens Republican, said of his GOP colleague, who is from Savannah, in an interview.\n",
              "Broun and Kingston are part of a crowded field of Republicans vying for the GOP U.S. Senate nomination, with the primary scheduled for May 2014. The incumbent, Saxby Chambliss, has announced his plans to retire.\n",
              "The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Political Insider column reported about Broun’s comments and mused, \"If you listen closely, you can hear Politifact hounds baying in the distance.\"\n",
              "We’re baying.\n",
              "Broun has been a vocal critic of earmarks and, apparently, is hoping to live high on the hog by criticizing Kingston on the issue. Kingston said criticism of the practice prodded him to trim back his own requests, the AJC reported in July 2008. The AJC article reported Kingston’s concerns that other states would get more money for various projects if Georgia lawmakers demurred from seeking earmarks.\n",
              "Broun spokeswoman Christine Hardman said the congressman based his claim by examining several databases created by Taxpayers for Common Sense, a budget watchdog group. The nonprofit has staffers who’ve worked for Democrats and Republicans.\n",
              "Broun, though, made a mistake in his interview with the Tea Party News Network.\n",
              "\"What Congressman Broun should have clarified was that at one point, Congressman Kingston had more earmarks than the entire Republican Georgia delegation combined,\" Hardman told us via email.\n",
              "PolitiFact Georgia was still curious about where Kingston stood in comparison to his GOP colleagues when it comes to earmarks. The Taxpayers for Common Sense website has databases for the federal fiscal years 2008 through 2010 that allow users to conduct searches to see how much money each member of Congress pulled in through earmarks.\n",
              "The federal fiscal year begins Oct. 1 and ends Sept. 30.\n",
              "Our review of the databases shows Kingston had more solo earmarks than his Georgia Republican colleagues in fiscal years 2008 and 2010. In 2008, Kingston had 21 earmarks that totaled about $17 million. His GOP colleagues from Georgia had 19 earmarks that totaled approximately $13 million. In fiscal year 2010, we found 18 solo earmarks for Kingston that totaled $24.3 million. The Republicans from Georgia had 15 earmarks that totaled $7.6 million.\n",
              "In fiscal year 2008, the Democrats from the Georgia congressional delegation recorded 48 individual earmarks that totaled about $26.5 million. In 2010, Democratic lawmakers from Georgia collected 65 earmarks worth a total of $33.5 million. The totals from the Democrats alone were higher than Kingston’s total.\n",
              "PolitiFact Georgia also reviewed the earmarks database of the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit organization that follows the money in Washington. The center is funded by foundation grants and individual donations and does not accept money from corporations, labor unions, or trade associations.\n",
              "The center’s totals were slightly different than what we found on the Taxpayers for Common Sense website. One commonality was that Kingston’s solo earmarks total did not exceed the entire Georgia delegation in 2008 or 2010. One difference we found was that Georgia’s GOP delegation had more solo earmarks and brought home more money in fiscal year 2008 than Kingston did. In 2010, we found Kingston had more earmarks and more money from those earmarks than the Republican delegation.\n",
              "So where does this all lead us? Broun meant to say Kingston had more earmarks at one point than the entire Georgia Republican delegation. Broun might have received a True if he had said that in the interview. It appears that Kingston had scored more earmarks than the entire Georgia GOP delegation to Congress in 2010 from our examination of two separate databases. Broun, however, misspoke in the interview, giving anyone who viewed it the wrong impression of Kingston’s record on earmarks., \"(James) Comey knew murdered DNC staffer, Seth Rich, was WikiLeaks source & covered it up for Hillary (Clinton).\" A conspiracy theory that said former FBI director James Comey was covering up the source of leaked Democratic National Committee emails for Hillary Clinton is based on a single source that has admitted he had no evidence.\n",
              "The headline on a May 16, 2017, post on PatriotCrier.com read, \"Bombshell: Comey knew murdered DNC staffer, Seth Rich, was WikiLeaks source & covered it up for Hillary.\" Facebook users flagged the story in an effort to identify potential fake news.\n",
              "The post is based on a persistent and unfounded conspiracy theory about how the website WikiLeaks came by thousands of internal DNC emails during last year’s presidential election.\n",
              "Seth Rich's death\n",
              "Seth Rich was a 27-year-old voter access projects staffer for the DNC who was shot and killed near his Washington home on July 10, 2016. The case is still unsolved, but Washington police said it was probably a botched robbery.\n",
              "WikiLeaks published thousands of emails a few days after Rich’s death. Some conspiracy theorists have concluded that Rich must have been the one who leaked the emails, and was killed to scare other potential leakers. WikiLeaks offered $20,000 for more information about Rich’s death, drawing some attention to the scenario.\n",
              "WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has never said Rich was the source.\n",
              "On May 15, Rod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by Rich’s family, claimed he could prove Rich was indeed the source of the leak. He told Washington-area Fox affiliate WTTG that sources in the FBI said they had evidence proving it.\n",
              "The next day, Fox News reported an anonymous federal investigator backed up what Wheeler was saying. This official said the FBI had determined Rich had been in contact with WikiLeaks, sending them more than 40,000 DNC emails.\n",
              "Most of the PatriotCrier.com conspiracy theory is based on this unfounded insistence that the FBI has proof of this connection.\n",
              "\"It’s apparent that Wheeler was being guarded in giving his statement, but the fact is the FBI has been in possession of Rich’s laptop and the agency’s director at the time, James Comey, locked down the contents to protect either certain people at the DNC, or members of Hillary’s campaign team, or Hillary Clinton, or likely all three,\" the PatriotCrier.com post read.\n",
              "There is no contact information on PatriotCrier.com, and we did not receive a response when we contacted the site through an affiliated Facebook page . The site’s registration information is hidden .\n",
              "It’s quite a stretch to pin on an anonymous federal investigator that Comey examined the evidence, drew a conclusion that proved Rich was the WikiLeaks source and then hid it specifically to protect Clinton.\n",
              "Wheeler didn’t even mention the former FBI director, and we didn’t find any evidence of Comey commenting on Rich’s death. The entire conspiracy theory had been under the radar, confined to corners of the Internet, until Wheeler’s story emerged, by which time Comey had been fired by President Donald Trump.\n",
              "But the more egregious problem with the PatriotCrier.com post is that it didn’t include what happened next: Wheeler admitted to CNN on March 16 that he had actually gotten the information from the Fox News reporter to whom he had discussed the issue.\n",
              "The Rich family sent Wheeler a cease-and-desist letter , saying their son was not WikiLeaks ’ source. They also demanded retractions from Fox for reporting the story.\n",
              "Fox News eventually retracted its story and removed it from FoxNews.com. WTTG posted a follow-up to its story , saying Wheeler had backtracked on what he described as a \"miscommunication.\"\n",
              "The FBI has not officially acknowledged conducting an investigation ( a WhiteHouse.gov petition demanding Comey get involved was created in January 2017, but has so far only garnered about 1,000 signatures).\n",
              "Some media outlets have reported that anonymous FBI and law enforcement officials confirmed the agency is not investigating Rich’s death, and that Washington police never gave them Rich’s laptop and therefore the agency hadn’t examined its contents.\n",
              "An FBI spokeswoman confirmed only that Rich's death was being investigated by the Metropolitan Police Department.\n",
              "What the FBI did do is alert the DNC of a data breach prior to the WikiLeaks release, and subsequently connected the breach to hackers with Russian ties .\n",
              "The only other source even remotely supporting the idea Rich was involved is a hacker living in New Zealand named Kim Dotcom. He said someone going by the name of Panda had contacted him in 2014 to get help starting a political group in the United States. Dotcom said he is certain Panda was actually Rich, and knows that Rich was the WikiLeaks source. He has not shown any proof.\n",
              "Dotcom is currently facing extradition to the United States on a host of conspiracy and racketeering charges levied by the Justice Department. Rich’s family also has denied the link Dotcom is making between Rich and WikiLeaks, and has said Dotcom actually tried to plant bogus evidence implicating Rich . And in any event, the PatriotCrier.com post didn’t make any mention of Dotcom or his claims.\n",
              "The Metropolitan Police Department, meanwhile, is still investigating Rich’s death as a homicide., \"(Jeb) Bush, not the State of Florida, decided which private emails to disclose.\" While all the attention is on Hillary Clinton’s email records, one left-leaning political action committee wants to remind everyone about a correspondence flap from another potential presidential candidate -- former Gov. Jeb Bush.\n",
              "American Bridge 21st Century posted on its website a reaction to a March 2 tweet Bush sent out about Clinton’s use of a private email account while she was Secretary of State. The PAC pointed out that Bush also had used a private account as governor, and had repeatedly defended his own editing of what emails would become part of the Florida public record.\n",
              "\"Media accounts establish that Bush, not the State of Florida, decided which private emails to disclose – apparently nothing would have stopped the Bush team from selectively leaving out politically problematic emails,\" the American Bridge website read.\n",
              "Does Florida’s open records law allow Bush (and all other of the state’s elected officials) to hand-select what emails they make available to the public? Sure enough, it does, but there’s more to it than just letting politicians self-report emails.\n",
              "Mail call\n",
              "Bush famously used the personal email address Jeb@jeb.org for all eight years of his two terms, from 1999 to 2007. He cultivated an open and tech-savvy image by announcing in December 2014 he would post more than 250,000 emails from his time as governor, ahead of a possible 2016 presidential run.\n",
              "In February 2015, jebbushemails.com went live with a quarter-million emails and the first chapter of an e-book Bush was writing about being governor.\n",
              "But there are a few things about the release that sometimes get overlooked.\n",
              "First, those emails were selected from messages already available from the state archives as of December, so the disclosure wasn’t entirely new. Bloomberg reported Bush didn’t submit all of his email until earlier in 2014 -- more than seven years after he left office.\n",
              "The Sunshine Law states an official must turn in records \"at the expiration of his or her term of office.\" Documentation from the Florida Department of State shows that Bush’s public records were transferred to the state archives several times since November 2007, most recently in June 2014 . The last batch is described as \"Additional 2002-2003 emails.\"\n",
              "Next, and this gets to the heart of what American Bridge said, is that the messages sent to the archives and subsequently posted on Bush’s website are only a portion of all his correspondence during his term. Bush in 2007 said that he had received 550,000 emails through the Jeb@jeb.org address -- plus another 2.5 million through his public email address -- so obviously plenty were not included in the batch of about 250,000 that the Bush team posted in February.\n",
              "As American Bridge said, Bush decided what would go to the archives and what wouldn’t. The PAC told us that’s comparable to Hillary Clinton’s situation and is therefore hypocritical. (We’ll leave it to readers to decide what’s hypocritical and what’s not.)\n",
              "Bush’s camp told PolitiFact Florida that he had more than satisfied state reporting requirements.\n",
              "\"Governor Bush complied with Florida’s broad public records laws for more than 15 years, beyond what was even required by the law,\" Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell. \"His emails related to state business have been available via requests to the state for that entire period of time.\"\n",
              "The emails Bush turned over to the state are only the ones he self-selected as pertaining to state business. He left out messages concerning politics, family matters and fundraising -- although there are several emails from donors posted on the site. Bush acknowledged he kept his emails on a private server .\n",
              "But while American Bridge tried to draw a parallel between Bush’s self-selection and Clinton’s current dilemma , we found nothing to suggest Bush’s editing had violated Florida’s Sunshine Law. State statute allows officials or an authorized custodian to determine which emails go into the public record based on whether they pertain to state business. The state archives only receive and preserve them.\n",
              "Another big difference is that while Clinton was not open about her private email use, Bush was transparent about the fact that he was using a private account, according to First Amendment Foundation president Barbara Petersen.\n",
              "\"There’s nothing in the public records law about personal accounts,\" Petersen said about rules in Florida. \"Some agencies have policies discouraging the use of personal accounts, but that was after Bush left office.\"\n",
              "If there is any question that emails had been left out of Bush’s disclosure, a person or group could make a public records request and file a civil suit if they think something’s missing, she said. State law does allow private inspections of electronic devices if warranted to find missing texts and emails. But no one has made that challenge of Bush, Petersen said.\n",
              "Overall, the emails provide Bush with a talking point leading up to 2016, said Bill Allison, senior fellow at the Sunlight Foundation. He’s done what Florida law requires and exerted pressure on his presumptive Republican rivals.\n",
              "\"Once you create the expectation to become transparent about something, people will expect that,\" Allison said. \"I’m not sure this will catch on the same way as health records and tax returns, but it could make it very difficult for candidates who do not comply.\", \"(Jeff) Atwater's bank was so weak that just a few months ago it was shut down by the FDIC.\" A web ad by the Democratic nominee for chief financial officer has her Republican opponent crying foul.\n",

              "First, let's establish Atwater's role and time at Riverside.\n",
              "Atwater's background at Riverside\n",
              "Atwater, of North Palm Beach, oversaw business development at Riverside Bank's Palm Beach County branches from 2002 to February 2009. When he left the bank, it had more than 60 branches and more than 1,000 employees in Florida.\n",
              "Atwater told PolitiFact Florida he left the bank to focus on his responsibilities as Senate President.\n",
              "In newspaper articles, Atwater had been listed as Palm Beach County president of Riverside National Bank.\n",
              "But a bank spokeswoman told the Palm Beach Post that Atwater functioned as a \"regional business development manager\" at the bank's Palm Beach County branches. Atwater's 2008 pay from Riverside was $199,833 and he listed his title as \"EVP\" on his 2009 financial disclosure statement.\n",
              "Atwater spokesman Hughes says that stands for executive vice president.\n",
              "\"The reality is it's a local community bank, one in which his title was vice president,\" Hughes said. \"But his day-to-day responsibility was almost that of a regional branch manger. He worked with a few local branches.\"\n",
              "So Atwater was definitely a manager at the bank, and likely one of its higher-paid executives. He was not a member of the board of directors, however, and maintains he had no direct say in the bank's loan-making process.\n",
              "Bank finds itself in trouble\n",
              "On May 27, 2009 -- about three months after Atwater left Riverside -- the bank was one of seven in Florida that failed to hold the amount of money required by regulators, according to the St. Petersburg Times .\n",
              "And the Palm Beach Post reported on May 29 that Riverside was ranked among the weakest in the nation, according to TheStreet.com .\n",
              "Fast forward to April 16, 2010, almost a year later.\n",
              "The FDIC announced that it was closing Riverside National Bank and that TD Bank was taking over its accounts. Riverside, and two other Florida banks, were closed in order \"to protect depositors,\" according to the FDIC.\n",
              "In its announcement, the FDIC said the cost to the FDIC's insurance fund to guarantee the bank's obligations was $491.8 million.\n",
              "The Post documented the bank's closure this way:\n",
              "FORT PIERCE — Beset by steep losses and unable to raise much-needed capital, Riverside National Bank was closed by federal regulators Friday.\n",
              "Its business was taken over by TD Bank, the U.S. arm of Toronto-Dominion Bank. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said Riverside's failure is expected to cost the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund $492 million.\n",
              "Riverside, a stalwart of St. Lucie County’s business community, was the second-largest of the 25 Florida banks shuttered by the FDIC since August 2008.\n",
              "Riverside had 58 offices from Palm Beach County to Volusia County. Its $3.4 billion in assets made it the seventh-­largest bank headquartered in Florida.\n",
              "Riverside posted huge losses in the past two years, including red ink of $138.9 million in 2008 and $131 million in 2009.\n",
              "\"This was a dead bank walking,\" said Miami banking analyst Ken Thomas. \"The question is why has the FDIC let them flail away for so long.\"\n",
              "The article noted that Riverside was hit hard by the collapse of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2008, rendering Riverside's securities in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac worthless. Loan losses escalated. Atwater isn't mentioned in the story.\n",
              "Back to the ad\n",
              "Ausley's ad makes three basic claims.\n",
              "First, that Atwater worked as an executive at Riverside National Bank. That's true.\n",
              "Second, that the bank was rated one of the weakest in Florida. That's true.\n",
              "And third, that Riverside eventually was shut down by federal regulators. Also true.\n",
              "But the problem is the 30-second spot splices together those three events like they happened within weeks of each other, when really they were separated by 14 months.\n",
              "Why is that important to know? Because Atwater was no longer working at Riverside when the bank was either rated weak, or shut down. That alone doesn't mean Atwater can't be culpable. And we imagine he had to at least be aware of the bank's financial problems, considering it posted a $138.9 million loss in 2008. But the ad's references to \"Atwater's bank\" are misleading, because it's more accurately described as \"Atwater's former bank.\"\n",
              "Naturally, the question of culpability is harder to determine -- and one we're not ruling on.\n",
              "We can, however, rule on the specific claim in Ausley's ad. She said, \"Atwater's bank was so weak that just a few months ago it was shut down by the FDIC.\"\n",
              "At the time, it wasn't Atwater's bank. It may have been his former bank, or best yet, it was a bank where he used to work as an executive vice president., \"(Jeff) Atwater's busy helping his friends and wasting our tax dollars -- $48 million for a government building so lavish it's dubbed the 'Taj Mahal,' $100,000 for a golf musuem, and $110 million to build a private prison to help a big contributor.\" Another day on the campaign trail in Florida, another accusation that a politician is spending tax dollars recklessly.\n",
              "This time the accused is state Sen. Jeff Atwater, the Republican candidate for chief financial officer. The accuser is his Democratic opponent, former state Rep. Loranne Ausley.\n",
              "\"Tallahassee's a mess, and Jeff Atwater's part of the problem,\" a narrator says in a TV ad Ausley unveiled Oct. 11, 2010 . \"Atwater's busy helping his friends and wasting our tax dollars -- $48 million for a government building so lavish it's dubbed the 'Taj Mahal,' $100,000 for a golf museum, and $110 million to build a private prison to help a big contributor.\"\n",
              "Enter the ad's foil, who (can you believe it?) just happens to be Ausley.\n",
              "\"I'm Loranne Ausley, and as chief financial officer I'll eliminate pay-to-play contracts and hold politicians like Jeff Atwater accountable for how they spend our tax dollars,\" Ausley says. \"It's time to clean up the mess in Tallahassee.\"\n",
              "The three projects Ausley questioned span seven years of Atwater's legislative history, starting in 2003. Let's take a look at each.\n",
              "The $100,000 for a golf museum\n",
              "As a freshman state senator in January 2003, Atwater requested $100,000 to help cover future expenses at the PGA Historical Center in Palm Beach Gardens. The money was included in Community Budget Issue Request -- which is a budget request legislators make for local projects, the state's version of an earmark. State Rep. Carl Domino, R-Jupiter, made a matching request in the state House.\n",
              "The historical center is akin to a golf museum, according to the PGA's website, and features displays of the four major championship trophies and the PGA Golf Professional Hall of Fame.\n",
              "CBIRs, love them or hate them, have been part of the legislative process. (The Legislature stopped the practice in 2009). Ausley has her share of budget requests over eight years in the state House: $400,000 for design, development and construction of public improvements adjacent to the Capitol Center in Tallahassee; $300,000 to help create an information kit for new parents; and $400,000 to restore Tallahassee's waterworks building, are just a few.\n",
              "A lot of times, CBIRs don't get funded. That's the case here -- Atwater's $100,000 request didn't make it into the final 2003-2004 budget.\n",
              "The 'Taj Mahal' courthouse\n",
              "The genesis of the $48 million 'Taj Mahal' 1st District Court of Appeals courthouse came in the form of a bond issue slipped into a 142-page transportation bill on the last day of the 2007 session. Plans for the Tallahassee courthouse included mahogany paneling, 60-inch LCD flat screen televisions for each judge, a private bathroom for each judge (featuring granite countertops) and an accompanying kitchen (complete with microwave and refrigerator).\n",
              "The construction project has been widely panned by elected leaders who said they didn't know that funding was inserted into a transportation bill or blame someone else for letting the building costs rage out of control. The Department of Revenue, for instance, recently constructed a new building at $225 per square foot. The cost of the new courthouse, which will house about 120 state employees? About $425 a square foot.\n",
              "What was Atwater's role in approving the courthouse project?\n",
              "The only link we could find, and the only one the Ausley campaign provided, was that he voted for the transportation bill, HB 985 . The bill passed the Senate 37-2. Atwater says he simply voted for a bond issue for the project and that the construction details were handled by the court system and the state building agency. \"Apparently I personally went out and hand-built the 1st DCA building,\" he told the St. Petersburg Times.\n",
              "The Times' Lucy Morgan obtained an e-mail circulated among the judges on the courthouse building committee identifying \"heroes'' in delivering the money to build it. The list includes five Republican state senators, then-House speaker Marco Rubio, and others, but not Atwater. And an audit of the courthouse project, ordered by current Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink, largely laid blame for the project at the feet of the court and the Department of Management Services, the state agency that oversees construction and leasing of state buildings. Authorization of the bond issue put DMS in charge of the project.\n",
              "Ausley voted against the transportation bill in the House, but says she did not know about the amendment that was added to build the courthouse.\n",
              "The $110 million private prison\n",
              "In 2008, with Florida's prison population growing and expected to continue to grow rapidly, lawmakers added hundreds of millions of dollars in the state budget to construct new prison facilities.\n",
              "Included in the budget was a requirement that the state use some of the money to build a 2,000-bed, $110 million privately operated correctional facility. Proponents say privately run facilities cost taxpayers less, but they are opposed by police unions. It wasn't a new concept -- the state already had six privately managed prison facilities.\n",
              "Atwater's role in the private prison deal? All we could find is that he voted for the state budget, which included the appropriation. Ausley voted against the budget that year. The private prison clause, it turns out, was inserted by former state Rep. Ray Sansom, the one-time Republican House speaker who resigned in disgrace in 2010.\n",
              "The deal did include a requirement that the contract to build the facility be competitively bid. The contract was won by The GEO Group, of Boca Raton -- one of two companies already managing private prison facilities in Florida. The GEO Group manages or owns 116 corrections facilities worldwide.\n",
              "Fast forward to this spring. The private prison, now called the Blackwater River Correctional Facility, was nearing completion but because the prison population hadn't grown as anticipated it had no potential prisoners to take in. Atwater, as Senate president, helped craft a budget deal to allow the new private prison to open by shifting some inmates from state-run prisons to the Blackwater River facility.\n",
              "As we already noted, The GEO Group won the contract to build Blackwater River after Atwater voted for the state budget, which passed the Senate 32-8. But since Ausley talks about The GEO Group as a \"big contributor\" in the ad, we decided to check that claim out, too. Since 2000 when Atwater was first elected to the state House, The GEO Group, its political action committee and subsidiaries have donated $2,500 to Atwater's campaigns, according to a review of campaign finance records.\n",
              "In the 2010 election cycle alone, The GEO Group's PAC has contributed almost $236,000 to candidates -- including $500 to Democratic gubernatorial candidate Alex Sink and $500 to Democratic House leader Franklin Sands.\n",
              "Summary\n",
              "Along with the claims, Ausley's ad includes visuals of an actor who plays Atwater accepting envelopes from men in suits and then tucking those envelopes into his jacket pocket. That's an obvious and dubious suggestion that somehow Atwater is taking bribes or kickbacks for his votes. We note it only for its ridiculousness.\n",
              "Ausley makes three claims about Atwater helping his friends and wasting taxpayer dollars. The $100,000 for the PGA golf museum was not included in the state budget. The only connections between Atwater and the 1st District Court of Appeals courthouse project and a 2,000-bed private prison are that Atwater voted on massive bills that included these projects and lots of other things. The ad makes it sound somehow like Atwater was spearheading or directing these projects, when there is zero evidence he was., \"(John McCain) was even mentioned as a running mate with John Kerry.\" Republicans have often questioned Sen. John McCain's conservative stripes, and the idea that he was a potential running mate for Democrat John Kerry in 2004 stokes their suspicions even more.\n",
              "The advocacy group Citizens United Political Victory Fund is currently on the attack, launching an ad that at first appears to be aimed at Hillary Clinton.\n",
              "\"One candidate voted against the Bush tax cuts, both times. ... And was even mentioned as a running mate with John Kerry.\"\n",
              "A photo of Clinton slides over to reveal McCain; the narrator says, \"Hillary Clinton? No. John McCain.\"\n",
              "We checked the claim on McCain's votes here.\n",
              "As for the charge that McCain was mentioned as a running mate with Democratic nominee John Kerry in 2004? That's true.\n",
              "There are many, many references in the media to the idea that McCain was possible for the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket. Here are just a few:\n",
              "• In March 2004, reports about the offer prompted Good Morning America host Charles Gibson to ask McCain about it in an interview on the show. McCain answered: \"John Kerry is a very close friend of mine. We've been friends for years. Obviously, I would entertain it. But there's, I see no scenario, no scenario, no scenario where I, I foresee no scenario where that would happen.\"\n",
              "• After Kerry picked John Edwards as his running mate in July 2004, the Washington Post reported that Kerry initiated phone calls to McCain about a possible crossover ticket, \"but McCain made clear he was not interested.\"\n",
              "• A February 2007 article in Vanity Fair magazine titled \"Prisoner of Conscience\" says: \"Kerry felt close enough to McCain at the time to make multiple and serious inquiries about McCain's interest in running for vice president on a national-unity ticket (and McCain basked in the courtship, even if he knew nothing could ever come of it).\n",
              "• And, in an April 2007 interview with the Web site myDD.com (Direct Democracy for People-Powered Politics), Kerry says McCain's people approached him about being on the Democratic ticket. Responding to suggestions that McCain had approached prominent Democrats about switching parties, Kerry says: \"It doesn't surprise me completely because his people similarly approached me to engage in a discussion about his potentially being on the ticket as vice president. So his people were active — let's put it that way.\"\n",
              "We're not saying McCain gave the idea much thought or even that he was offered the job, but it's clear he \"was mentioned as a running mate with John Kerry.\" We rule this statement True., \"(John) Kasich was the architect who balanced the budget, cut spending, created a surplus, igniting record job creation.\" Jobs are the central theme of this fall’s election campaigns, and John Kasich's TV ad \"Busted\" neatly delivers the Republican candidate's two-pronged message about the state's economy: The policies of Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland have failed, and Kasich can do better.\n",
              "\"Kasich,\" the ad says, \"was the architect who balanced the budget, cut spending, created a surplus, igniting record job creation.\"\n",
              "It's a sweeping claim that begs for explanation and context. The ad doesn't provide it. Neither does the posting about the ad on the campaign's blog, though it more helpfully calls Kasich \"chief architect of the 1997 Balanced Budget.\"\n",
              "PolitiFact Ohio looked into the record for more.\n",
              "We started with \"Balanced Budget.\" That refers to the federal Balanced Budget Act of 1997, H.R . 2015, a bipartisan agreement to balance the federal budget by the year 2002. The 537-page bill was sponsored by Kasich, a U.S. House member representing a suburban Columbus district from 1983 through 2000 and chairman of the House Budget Committee.\n",
              "The legislation also promised the first major tax cuts in 16 years, and it reduced Medicare and Medicaid payments to health care providers.\n",
              "Kasich was widely recognized as the its chief architect and a key player in negotiating its passage. When President Clinton signed the agreement into law, Kasich stood beside him in the Rose Garden.\n",
              "Failure is an orphan, but success has a thousand fathers -- or custody-seekers.\n",
              "Newt Gingrich, Kasich's mentor and then-speaker of the House, called him \"a historic figure. More than any single man, he is responsible for balancing the budget.\"\n",
              "Clinton, appearing in Cleveland for Strickland in September, said Kasich \"always tells people that he brokered for the Republicans the balanced-budget bill that I signed. That is true but misleading\" -- because, Clinton said, Kasich earlier was among congressional Republicans who shut down the government because the president refused to slash federal agencies and programs.\n",
              "Regardless, conditions were comparatively favorable for the budget agreement. It came amid a booming economy and increased tax revenues that already had driven down the deficit, ultimately leading to a surplus. (The increase in tax revenues is credited to the improved economy and to tax increases that were part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.)\n",
              "Clinton announced that surplus in September 1998, a year after the agreement was signed. It was the first U.S. budget surplus in 29 years. Federal budgets were balanced in both fiscal 1999 and fiscal 2000.\n",
              "Republicans claimed credit, saying they had pressured Clinton to adopt their balanced-budget commitment.\n",
              "Clinton said he and congressional Democrats deserved the credit for passing the 1993 budget bill, which did not win a single Republican vote in the House and which Cinton has said \"led to an enormous flowering of the economy in America.\" ( PolitiFact examined that claim in detail last April and rated it Half True. The economy did improve after the 1993 budget bill became law, but economists say many factors played a role.)\n",
              "Unemployment was one key indicator of the economy's health. It fell from 4.9 percent in 1997 to 3.9 percent in 2000, continuing a steady decrease that started in 1993.\n",
              "But the impressive amount of job creation does not mean that a record number of jobs were added.\n",
              "According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the economy added 3,154,000 jobs in 1998 -- about 100,000 more than were created in 1997 -- and another 3,063,000 in 1999. But neither year reaches the peak of 3,447,000 jobs in 1994. (Job creation began to slow in 2000.)\n",
              "Kasich deserves credit for conceiving, sponsoring and negotiating passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n",
              "But the ad overstates his role by saying he balanced the budget. And it exaggerates by giving Kasich, or the the budget agreement, credit for a surplus or \"record\" job creation., \"(Koch Industries) is among the worst in toxic air pollution in the entire United States ... and churns out more climate-changing greenhouse gases than oil giants Chevron, Shell and Valero.\" Charles and David Koch might be two of the people happiest about Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid’s impending retirement.\n",
              "The Nevada Democrat’s undisguised disdain for the billionaire brothers’ bankrolling of conservative groups is well-documented , and Reid’s long crusade against the Kochs isn’t letting up as he nears retirement.\n",
              "Kicking off a coordinated effort to draw attention towards conservative-leaning nonprofits and climate change skeptics, Reid zeroed in on the Kochs and accused them of being worse polluters than major oil companies.\n",
              "\"The company is among the worst in toxic air pollution in the entire United States,\" he said during a July 11 floor speech . \"Koch Industries churns out more climate-changing greenhouse gases than oil giants Chevron, Shell and Valero.\"\n",
              "This isn’t the first time Reid has tried to connect the Kochs’ business operations with climate change, but we were curious to see which company has the worst environmental record.\n",
              "Measuring pollution\n",
              "Reached by email, a Reid spokesperson cited a 2014  Rolling Stone  article detailing the history behind the Koch family’s \"Toxic Empire,\" particularly a line stating \"Koch's climate pollution ... outpaces oil giants including Valero, Chevron and Shell.\"\n",
              "Rolling Stone cites a corporate polluter study published by the University of Massachusetts, Amherst’s Political Economy Research Institute. The \" Greenhouse 100 Polluters Index \" ranks Koch Industries 22nd on its list of polluters, creating more than 28 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions in 2014.\n",
              "The survey puts them ahead of the oil companies mentioned by Reid — Chevron (32nd), Royal Dutch Shell (27th) and Valero (26th) all produced fewer emissions in 2014 than Koch Industries, according to the report.\n",
              "Pretty clear, right?\n",
              "Koch Industries spokesman Ken Spain says Reid makes an unfair comparison between Koch and companies in essentially different industries with fewer facilities.\n",
              "\"It is misleading to compare Koch Industries — one of the largest and diversified manufacturers in the US — to much smaller companies,\" he said in a statement. \"Koch operates more than 200 manufacturing sites that employ 60,000 people in the U.S. Therefore, it is only logical that our GHG emissions are greater than a company that has far fewer facilities.\"\n",
              "Koch lands somewhere in the middle compared to the oil giants mentioned by Reid in terms of total revenue and employees, though they do own more facilities than the other three.  Spain does have a point that Koch is more involved in manufacturing and refining goods that actually extracting and selling fossil fuels.\n",
              "The corporation is ranked 13th on the \" Toxic 100 Air Polluters \" list due to the roughly 31 million pounds of toxic air releases reported by the facilities owned by the Kochs. But Koch Industries does have many more facilities than Shell , Chevron and Valero .\n",
              "Koch Industries’ sites actually emits millions more toxic air releases than the 12 companies ahead of them on the list, such as top polluters Dow Chemical and ExxonMobil. But the company ranks lower than those because the survey adjusts the rankings to include levels of toxicity in the pollution, not just the total amount.\n",
              "Still, out-ranking just 12 companies isn’t exactly an environmental badge of honor. The corporation has a long history of violating environmental rules.\n",
              "In 2000, the company was fined a record $30 million due to repeated violations of environmental law, including more than 300 oil spills in six states.\n",
              "Koch Petroleum and other major polluters also reached an accord with the EPA that same year over air pollution, agreeing to spend $80 million to reduce refinery emissions and pay a $4.5 million penalty in return for a \"clean slate\" from the EPA.\n",
              "Invista, a Koch-owned subsidy, agreed in 2009 to a $1.7 million penalty and promised to spend up to $500 million to fix more than 680 self-reported violations of EPA standards at 12 facilities owned by the subsidy.\n",
              "PolitiFact also rated Charles Koch’s comments about the corporation being a \" model for other companies \" in terms of environmental regulation Mostly False, largely due to the numerous environmental crimes committed by the company throughout the late ‘90s and early 2000s.\n",
              "But Koch appears to be turning the corner. Rolling Stone acknowledges that the company has improved its regulatory compliance over time, which in the words of Charles Koch required a \"monumental undertaking to integrate compliance into every aspect of the company.\"\n",
              "In a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, Koch environmental director Sheryl Corrigan said the company had reduced air emissions at its refineries by 76 percent since 1997. They’ve also downsized their oil pipeline business from a high of 37,000 miles of pipeline in the late 1990s to around 4,000.\n",
              "Spain also pointed out a 2014 EPA Toxics Release Inventory analysis, which tracks U.S. facilities that manage and release toxic chemicals. Koch-owned businesses managed 667 million pounds of production-related waste in 2014, but the company reported implementing 240 \" Source Reduction Activities \" over the same time period — more than Shell and Chevron (though the corporation listed many more facilities than the oil giants)., \"(M)ore Georgians have jobs than at any other time since October 2008.\" Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal sounded as optimistic as Ronald Reagan in the early moments of his State of the State address.\n",
              "\"The state of our state is excellent and it is a great day in Georgia,\" the Republican said.\n",
              "Excellent is a strong word considering the economic doldrums that Georgia has faced since 2008, when the American financial system nearly collapsed. But things are getting better, particularly the job market, Deal said.\n",
              "\"(M)ore Georgians have jobs than at any other time since October 2008,\" the governor said in his prepared remarks.\n",
              "Is this correct, we wondered.\n",
              "The Georgia Department of Labor keeps the most detailed data on employment in the Peach State. In October 2008, when the national economy was at the height of its financial crisis, there were 4,076,000 people employed in Georgia, its numbers show. The following month, the number of Georgians employed dropped to 4,051,500, the data shows.\n",
              "The employment numbers gradually declined and fell to its lowest levels in February 2010, the records show. That month, an estimated 3,838,500 Georgians were employed.\n",
              "Employment in Georgia has steadily increased since then. Last February was the first month in more than four years with the state’s employment exceeding the 4 million mark. As of November, the most recent month available, the estimated total was 4,072,200.\n",
              "That’s an increase of about 21,200 jobs since November 2008. It is the highest number of Georgians employed since that time.\n",
              "Georgia’s overall population increased about 4.7 percent during the same time period.\n",
              "So what’s happening here?\n",
              "Deal, who was sworn in as governor in January 2011, has touted initiatives such as increasing the deal-closing fund and ending the sales tax for energy used in manufacturing as helping bring jobs to Georgia and improving the state’s economy.\n",
              "The increase in Georgia mirrors a national increase in employment. The number of Americans employed increased by about 1.7 million people between November 2008 and November 2013. Critics say that despite the increase and a significant decline in the national unemployment rate over the past four years, all is not well with the economy. They say the decline in the unemployment rate doesn’t reflect how many people have given up looking for work.\n",
              "PolitiFact Georgia was still curious whether Deal was cherry-picking the job numbers to make him look good for his re-election bid. We looked at the employment numbers in Georgia since Deal took office on a cold and snowy morning in January 2011. There was an increase of about 217,000 jobs between that time and November 2013, according to the state Labor Department figures.\n",
              "Deal spokesman Brian Robinson said the employment numbers cited in the governor’s speech were seasonally adjusted to take into account changes in weather, harvests, major holidays and school schedules. Robinson said the actual numbers for Georgia may be even higher.\n",
              "In December, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Georgia had gained 91,200 jobs over the prior 12 months. The top areas for new jobs were professional and business services, leisure and hospitality, education and health services, transportation and warehousing, and construction. Still, the AJC noted that the state has replaced only 65 percent of the jobs that were lost when the recession began.\n",
              "Economists believe the job market will continue to improve in 2014, but some caution that the kinds of jobs available aren’t exactly offering the same kind of pay as baseball pitcher Clayton Kershaw, who last week signed a contract to make $30 million a year. Some prominent economists have projected that only one in five jobs added in 2014 will pay more than $60,000 a year, the AJC reported.\n",
              "To sum up, Deal said in his State of the State address that more Georgians have jobs than they did at any time since October 2008. Data from the state’s Labor Department supports the governor’s argument., \"(Mary) Burke was a senior member of the Doyle administration that left Wisconsin with 130,000 fewer jobs.\" The political playbook calls for campaigns to define their opponents before they can introduce themselves to voters.\n",
              "The Republican Governors Association is calling that play in the early downs of the 2014 Wisconsin governor’s race, attacking Democrat Mary Burke in her bid to unseat Republican Scott Walker.\n",
              "In one TV spot entitled \"Backward,\" the RGA asks: \"Who’s Mary Burke?\"\n",
              "It’s answer: \"Burke was a senior member of the Doyle administration that left Wisconsin with 130,000 fewer jobs, and a $3 billion budget shortfall.\" The ad concludes:  \"Mary Burke would take Wisconsin backwards.\"\n",
              "Did Burke, as state Commerce secretary under Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, throw Wisconsin for a six-digit jobs loss?\n",
              "As backup for the jobs claim, the RGA spot cites a very familiar source: A September 2013 item from PolitiFact Wisconsin.\n",
              "But in that item, we rated Mostly False a Walker claim that Doyle’s policies cost the state 133,000 jobs in his second term, from 2007 through 2010.\n",
              "Walker, we noted, got the number right. But experts said the national economic crash had far more to do with Wisconsin’s job losses during that period than any state policies. Indeed, Wisconsin actually fared somewhat better than the rest of the country.\n",
              "The claim in the RGA ad carries a subtle, but important difference.\n",
              "It does not mention Doyle’s second term as its timeframe. Rather, it makes an open-ended statement that those watching from their couch may likely hear as referring to Doyle’s full tenure in office.\n",
              "Beyond that, Burke worked for Doyle as Commerce secretary over parts of both his terms, but not nearly for the entire eight-year period. She started in February 2005, about halfway through Doyle’s first term, and left in November 2007 -- 10  months into Doyle’s second term.\n",
              "And the private-sector jobs picture changes dramatically if you look at Doyle’s full tenure or narrowly at Burke’s time as Commerce chief.\n",
              "We ran the numbers using US Bureau of Labor Statistics quarterly census of employment and wages data, considered the most accurate measurement:\n",
              "-- Burke’s state tenure: Gain of more than 55,000 jobs.\n",
              "-- Doyle’s full eight-year tenure: Loss of 47,413 jobs (gain of 86,530 in term one, loss of 133,943 in term two).\n",
              "To expand our analysis, we looked at two other scenarios:\n",
              "-- Start of Burke’s tenure to end of Doyle’s: loss of 77,267.\n",
              "-- Start of Doyle’s tenure to end of Burke’s: gain of at least 94,000.\n",
              "It’s apparent from these figures that the RGA ad cherrypicks the worst outcome for Burke by ignoring numbers from nearly two years she worked in Doyle’s first term -- even though that represented the majority of her time in state government.\n",
              "Indeed, the state’s private sector employment actually grew during Burke’s specific  time as Commerce secretary. (Data note: because of limitations stemming from how the data is reported, we had to slightly adjust the time frames covering Burke’s state tenure. But those adjustments do not alter the trends we found.)\n",
              "There’s something for the RGA to hang on to here, though, in that Burke was a holdover member of Doyle’s administration for a small part of a second term during which more than 130,000 jobs were lost in four years.\n",
              "RGA spokesman Jon Thompson defended the 130,000 figure, saying Burke had a hand in Doyle’s second term, but added that it is a \"fair comparison\" for others to look at all eight years of Doyle’s record.\n",
              "\"Wisconsin is still worse off when all is said and done, and has turned that corner under Walker,\" he said.\n",
              "Blame game\n",
              "The historical backdrop here is that until mid-2008, employment in Wisconsin was rising, as it had for years.\n",
              "In June 2008, seven months after Burke departed, the total employment count started a big slide that was part of the Great Recession that swept the United States. The slide ended in mid-2010, in Doyle’s final year, and the monthly gains that started then have generally continued under Walker.\n",
              "In reality, neither Walker nor Burke deserve much of the credit or blame for job trends, particularly ones driven by an event as sharp as the Great Recession, economists have told us repeatedly. No governor -- much less a department head -- has much influence on the state jobs picture in the face of strongly negative national economic trends, they said.\n",
              "To be sure, Burke highlights the job gains during her time while skipping over the recession.\n",
              "That omission earned her a Half True when in October of 2013 she picked an entirely different time frame and said her actions as Commerce secretary brought the state 84,000 more jobs than we have today., \"(Mary) Burke’s company,\" Trek Bicycles, \"makes 99% of their bikes overseas.\" With his popularity among conservatives still high, and a poll showing his support dropping among independents, Gov. Scott Walker is working to dampen liberals’ enthusiasm for his main Democratic rival in the November 2014  election.\n",
              "Here’s part of his second campaign TV ad hitting Mary Burke’s former employer, Wisconsin’s Trek Bicycles, for building products overseas:\n",
              "\"Mary Burke is trying to sell us on her experience at her family business, but she forgot to mention they make 99% of their bikes overseas, in places like China, where her company has outsourced jobs for years,\" a narrator says. The spot adds that \"Burke’s company  makes almost all their bikes overseas.\"\n",
              "In her campaign, Burke has highlighted her former role as a manager at Trek, the company founded in 1976 by her father, Richard, in Waterloo. She has said that Trek, as a company trying to compete globally, does what it can to manufacture bikes in the United States and makes more bikes in America than any other manufacturer.\n",
              "The latest Walker ad cites an OnMilwaukee.com piece from Jan. 9, 2011, flashing what looks like a headline that reads: \"Over 99.5% Of The Bicycles That Burke’s Company Produces, Are Made Overseas.\"\n",
              "So that’s where we’ll start.\n",
              "The piece , a question-and-answer feature with a Trek spokesman, does not mention either Mary Burke or a figure of more than 99.5%.\n",
              "It ran under the headline \"Trek Corporation Committed To Wisconsin\" and highlighted Trek’s employment of nearly 1,000 people in the state at three facilities and another 800 around the world at the time.\n",
              "The story does not call Trek Mary Burke’s company, as Walker’s ad characterizes it.\n",
              "In one of her own campaign videos, Burke calls Trek \"my family’s business\" and one she says she helped grow into a worldwide force.\n",
              "But Burke left Trek’s employment in 2004, and its board in  2005, though she still owns stock in the private company.\n",
              "So the Walker ad seemingly is off to a rough start.\n",
              "But that OnMilwaukee piece did contain two numbers that allow a reader get a feeling for the balance of overseas versus domestic production at Trek, at least as of 2011.\n",
              "In the piece, Trek official Eric Bjorling is quoted as saying that Trek makes roughly 10,000 bikes a year in Wisconsin. Later in the story, in response to a separate question, he said that Trek sells about 1.5 million bikes a year around the world.\n",
              "We should note that Bjorling characterized the 10,000 figure as a rough estimate, saying it’s \"almost impossible to give a number\" because production is seasonal and demand-based.\n",
              "Nevertheless, doing the math yields an answer of 99.33 percent built overseas. So that works in Walker’s favor.\n",
              "We asked Trek company spokeswoman Marina Marich to comment on the ad and the number it presents, and she responded in part, \"As a privately held company, Trek doesn’t disclose specific production data.\" A Burke campaign spokesman simply referred us to Trek.\n",
              "Industry observers say that broadly speaking, the 99 percent figure makes sense.\n",
              "\"The bottom line is there is no major bicycle production in the U.S.,\" said Marc Sani, writer and former publisher of Bicycle Retailer & Industry News. \"It left when Schwinn went to China in the 1980s. That was the beginning of the end.\"\n",
              "Trek and other U.S.-based bicycle companies have little or no choice but to build product in cheaper venues overseas in order to compete globally, Sani said.\n",
              "Trek has two manufacturing facilities in Wisconsin -- one in Waterloo and one in Whitewater. Overseas, it builds in Germany, Holland and China. In 2011, CEO John Burke said Trek’s sales were more than $800 million.\n",
              "Trek contends, without providing numbers to back it up, that it manufactures more bikes the United States than any other bicycle company and is the only \"major\" bicycle company that stills manufactures product in the United States.\n",
              "As PolitiFact Wisconsin reported in January, Burke and Trek also have declined to document her claim that  while at Trek the European division she oversaw went from $3 million to over $50 million in sales.\"\n",
              "Jay Townley, a bicycle industry consultant based in Wisconsin, noted that because U.S. production is so low, the numbers are volatile.\n",
              "But even if it was 30,000 instead of 10,000, the overseas production share would be 98 percent, which still sounds a lot like the Walker ad’s phrasing that \"almost all\" of Trek’s bikes are made outside the United States., \"(McCain) said he was opposed to overturning Roe v. Wade. Now he's for overturning Roe v. Wade.\" The Roe v. Wade charge against John McCain seems to be the result of a verbal lapse eight years ago by the notably anti-abortion McCain. McCain had answered written questionnaires saying he opposed Roe v. Wade, but when the San Francisco Chronicle and CNN asked him about it in late 1999, McCain said, \"I'd love to see a point where it (the court ruling) is irrelevant, and could be repealed because abortion is no longer necessary. But certainly in the short-term, or even the long-term, I would not support repeal of Roe vs.  Wade, which would then force X number of women in America to (undergo) illegal and dangerous operations.\"\n",
              "McCain aides almost immediately started backpedaling from McCain's words, noting that McCain misspoke when he used the phrase \"even in the long term.\" McCain said in an interview a few months later, \"I clearly misspoke there. I'm a person who's made mistakes in this campaign, and I'll continue to make mistakes. My voting record is clear, of 17 years of pro-life. I continue to hold that position, and I … continue to believe that Roe vs. Wade was a very flawed decision, as in the opinion of most experts.\"\n",
              "In South Carolina this year, McCain said, \"I do not support Roe versus Wade. It should be overturned.\", \"(McCain) was opposed to ethanol. Now he's for it.\" On ethanol, McCain has maintained a long-standing opposition to subsidies for the alternative fuel and that hasn't changed. But the way he talks about ethanol has changed significantly. In 1999, he told an audience in Iowa, where corn-based ethanol is popular: \"I'm here to tell you the things you don't want to hear as well as the things you want to hear. One of those things is ethanol. Ethanol is not worth it. It does not help the consumers. … Those ethanol subsidies should be phased out. And everybody here on this stage, if it wasn't for the fact that Iowa is the first caucus state, would share my view that we don't need ethanol subsidies.\"\n",
              "In 2007, McCain started to speak more favorably of ethanol and admitted it was a position change. He told Tim Russert on \"Meet the Press\": \"It makes a lot of sense. We are dependent on foreign oil too much. We have a situation where greenhouse gases has now become--emissions has become a vital issue. I am for sugarcane, biofuels, switch grass, and corn-based ethanol because of our need for independence on foreign oil. … I have adjusted to the realities of the world we live in today, and if I don't adjust to those realities, then I would be stuck in the past.\"\n",
              "That's a significant change in opinion on the biofuel. We found the statement that McCain used to oppose ethanol but now supports it to be Mostly True., \"(Mexican immigrants) are more law-abiding than U.S. citizens and that is a statistic.\" Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson challenged Donald Trump’s label of Mexican immigrants as murderers and rapists, saying they actually follow the law more than U.S. citizens.\n",
              "In a July 3 interview on CNN’s State of the Union, Johnson spoke with host Brianna Keilar about comments the presumptive Republican nominee has made about Muslims and Mexicans.\n",
              "Johnson, a former New Mexico governor, said Trump has said things that would disqualify anyone else from running for president. Keilar asked Johnson if he thought Trump was racist.\n",
              "\"When it comes to Mexican immigration and that he would call immigrants from Mexico murderers and rapists look, that’s just not true,\" Johnson said. \"They are more law-abiding than U.S. citizens, and that is a statistic.\"\n",
              "We wondered if there really was a statistic to support Johnson’s statement that Mexican immigrants commit fewer crimes than U.S. citizens.\n",
              "Immigrants up, crime down\n",
              "Johnson based his comments on data cited in a July 2015  Wall Street Journal  opinion piece by Jason L. Riley, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning Manhattan Institute.\n",
              "Riley’s commentary focused on studies that show immigrants — irrespective of nationality or legal status — \"are less likely than the native population to commit violent crimes or to be incarcerated.\"\n",
              "Riley points to a July 2015 report by the American Immigration Council, a pro-immigrant nonprofit in Washington. The council analyzed data from the Census’ 2010 American Community Survey and found that about 1.6 percent of all immigrant males (Census does not specify legal status) between 18 and 39 years old were incarcerated, compared to 3.3 percent of the native-born population.\n",
              "The council also reported 2010 Census data that shows incarceration rates of young, less educated Mexican, Salvadoran and Guatemalan men — which comprise the bulk of the unauthorized population — are \"significantly lower\" than incarceration rates of native-born young men without a high-school diploma.\n",
              "Specifically for Mexican men ages 18 to 39, the incarceration rate in 2010 was 2.8 percent, compared to 10.7 percent for native-born men in the same age group, the council’s report said.\n",
              "Immigrants come to the United States to build better lives for themselves and their children, said Walter A. Ewing, a senior researcher at the American Immigration Council and one of the report’s authors.\n",
              "\"They are very motivated to not blow that opportunity by getting in trouble with the police,\" he said in an email interview. \"This is especially so for unauthorized immigrants, who can be deported at any time for unlawful presence.\"\n",
              "And even as the immigrant population increases, crime has gone down, the report said.\n",
              "Between 1990 and 2013, the foreign-born share of the U.S. population increased from 7.9 percent to 13.1 percent, and the number of unauthorized immigrants went up from 3.5 million to 11.2 million. At the same time, violent crime rate (murder, rape and aggravated assault) decreased 48 percent and property crime rate fell 41 percent, the report said, citing FBI data.\n",
              "Bianca E. Bersani, an assistant professor and director of the Criminology and Criminal Justice Program at the University of Massachusetts Boston, says her research also shows that crime involvement among foreign-born residents is lower than that of U.S.-born citizens.\n",
              "It holds true for Mexican immigrants, she said.\n",
              "\"When ethnicity can be distinguished and Mexican immigrants isolated from the group of first-generation immigrants, research continues to find that Mexican immigrants have lower rates of involvement in crime compared to their U.S-born peers,\" Bersani said.\n",
              "Recent studies tracking changes over time also found that areas of the country with an increased foreign-born population do not experience corresponding increases in crime, said Bersani.\n",
              "\"The rhetoric of the ‘criminal immigrant’ does not align with the bulk of empirical research,\" Bersani said.\n",
              "According to Bersani’s research , while first-generation immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the native-born population, the second generation (individuals born in the United States to at least one foreign-born parent) more closely resemble patterns of their native-born peers (three or more U.S.-born generations).\n",
              "\"This does not suggest that the second generation is uniquely crime prone, but instead that they are acting in ways that are no different from the rest of the U.S.-born population,\" Bersani said.\n",
              "Datasets with information on both crime and immigrant status are rare, Bersani said, though more research and data are becoming available.\n",
              "The Center for Immigration Studies, which supports stricter immigration policies, in a 2009 study said that overall understanding of immigrants and crime \"remains confused\" due to lack of data and contrary information.\n",
              "Unless inmates are identified as immigrant or native-born, incarceration rates are a poor way to measure links between immigrants and crime, the study said.\n",
              "Deportations of criminal immigrants may also decrease immigrant incarceration rates because many will not return to the United States and commit more crimes, as could be the case with native-born criminals, the CIS report said.\n",
              "There isn’t exact data on how many undocumented immigrants are currently incarcerated ., \"(My dad) used to campaign against the gas-guzzling dinosaurs.\" Republican Mitt Romney, speaking from the campaign trail in Michigan, recalled his father's legacy as the owner of American Motors Corp. and the car that changed the industry.\n",
              "\"But, you see, when I was growing up, the fact that we won the mileage championship year after year with the Rambler was a source of great pride for my dad,\" Romney said during an interview on the CBS Early Show . \"He used to campaign against the gas-guzzling dinosaurs.\"\n",
              "Romney used a similar line in February 2007 when he launched his presidential campaign in Michigan, where he was born. It's the kind of claim that could, in our current energy climate, be dismissed as rewritten history. Campaigning against gas-guzzling cars in the '50s? Really?\n",
              "And yet, this is not a case of inflated exuberance. George Romney took the helm at American Motors in 1954 and helped rescue the company from near financial ruin.\n",
              "He succeeded in large part on the sales of the Rambler, the first American compact car. In doing so, he had to sell the concept and value of a compact car. In 1958, he traveled 700,000 miles in his crusade against what he called \"gas-guzzling dinosaurs,\" a reference to the large cars produced by Detroit's Big Three automakers.\n",
              "\"Who wants to have a gas-guzzling dinosaur in his garage?\" he told Time magazine in 1959, for a cover article that labeled George Romney \"The Dinosaur Hunter.\"\n",
              "He is credited with coining the term, even though other automakers cast doubts on just how economical the Rambler really was. Still, the nickname, and the George Romney legend, took hold. It appeared in prominent obituaries after his death July 26, 1995.\n",

              "He didn't say he wanted to \"get rid of the Department of Education,\" as Romney claimed. He said the department needed to \"dramatically shrink.\" What did Gingrich say he would \"get rid of\"? \"Virtually all of its regulations,\" he said.\n",
              "Not the same thing.\n",
              "Gingrich's campaign website expands on his debate response, saying that he would \"shrink the federal Department of Education and return power to states and communities. The Department's only role will be to collect research and data and help find new and innovative approaches to then be adopted voluntarily at the local level.\"\n",
              "So he did advocate sending \"education issues back to the states,\" as Romney said, though not \"all.\" Gingrich would reserve some limited powers for the federal government.\n",
              "That's not to say Gingrich's positions on education haven't shifted over time.\n",
              "For example, a story this month in the nonprofit-funded Education Week pointed out that Gingrich backed a Republican effort in 1995 to get rid of the Education Department or merge it with the Labor Department. In 2009, he joined with Education Secretary Arne Duncan and civil rights activist Al Sharpton to \"call for raising academic standards, lifting state caps on high-quality charter schools and greater accountability.\", \"(Obama's) entire national security team, including his secretary of state, said we want to arm and train and equip (Syrian rebel forces), and he made the unilateral decision to turn them down.\" President Barack Obama spoke from the White House on Sept. 10 to announce his overall strategy for dealing with the growing regional threat presented by the terrorist group the Islamic State. Part of that includes asking Congress to authorize funds to arm Syrian rebels.\n",
              "After, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., had a terse exchange with former White House Press Secretary-turned-CNN contributor Jay Carney. McCain has supported arming Syrian opposition forces for years.\n",
              "\"I'm astounded that Mr. Carney should say that the Free Syrian Army is now stronger,\" McCain said, referring to moderate rebel fighters revolting against Syrian President Bashar al Assad. \"In fact, they have been badly damaged.\"\n",
              "Carney responded, \"That's not what I said, senator. What I said is that we know a great deal more about the makeup of the opposition.\"\n",
              "The back-and-forth continued. Carney eventually said, \"I think we have to agree to disagree on this.\" But McCain wasn’t done.\n",
              "\"No, no, facts are stubborn things, Mr. Carney, and that is, his entire national security team, including his secretary of state, said we want to arm and train and equip these people, and he made the unilateral decision to turn them down,\" McCain said.\n",
              "\"Facts\" are stubborn, but they also get misconstrued. Is that the case here, or is McCain accurately retelling history?\n",
              "Mass protests broke out in Syria in March 2011 against Assad, a powerful dictator, as the Arab spring continued to spark unrest in the region. Over the next two years, the situation in the country would escalate dramatically, with Assad turning his army on his own people and Syrians in turn taking up arms against the regime.\n",
              "McCain and some of his congressional colleagues called for Obama to arm opposition groups, but the administration rejected those options.\n",
              "McCain’s office noted that in February 2013, outgoing Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staffs, testified at a Senate Armed Services Committee that they supported a proposal to arm some rebels.\n",
              "\"Did you support the recommendation … that we provide weapons to the resistance in Syria?\" McCain asked. \"Did you support that?\"\n",
              "\"We did,\" Panetta replied.\n",
              "\"You did support that,\" McCain said.\n",
              "\"We did,\" Dempsey added.\n",
              "Until that point, those divisions between Panetta and Dempsey and the White House were not public. And they likely only emerged because Panetta was on the way out after serving four years in the administration.\n",
              "We learned more about this debate from another former member of the national security team, Hillary Clinton, thanks to her memoir Hard Choices, which recounted her time as secretary of state.\n",
              "In the book, Clinton said she was reluctant to support efforts to arm Syrian opposition forces. She was reminded of the Afghan fighters who, armed with American guns to take on the Soviet Union, went on to form al-Qaida.\n",
              "But in late-summer of 2012, she came to support a proposal put together by CIA director David Petraeus to provide some arms assistance and training to vetted groups so the United States would have an ally on the ground.\n",
              "\"The best I could say for it was that it was the least bad option among many even worse alternatives,\" she wrote.\n",
              "Obama, however, wasn’t convinced.\n",
              "\"He worried that arming the rebels was not likely to be enough to drive Assad from power and that with all the weapons already flowing into the country from Arab nations, our contributions would hardly be decisive,\" she said.\n",
              "In summary, the plan to arm rebels had the support of the secretary of state, the secretary of defense, the CIA director and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. That’s a pretty convincing argument for McCain.\n",
              "But Clinton goes on to note that, \"Despite high-level support from the National Security Council, some at the White House were skeptical. After all, the president had been elected in large part because of his opposition to the war in Iraq and his promise to bring troops home.\"\n",
              "McCain said the \"entire National Security Team\" supported arming the rebels, but Clinton notes there was division within some quarters of the White House.\n",
              "Whether McCain exaggerated his point comes down to how you define the national security team. McCain’s spokesman said, \"The Senate-confirmed heads of the Pentagon, State Department, CIA and uniformed military are generally considered a president's national security team.\"\n",
              "But the White House told PolitiFact that on \"his national security team are also numerous members of the (National Security Council) staff, like the deputy national security advisors, for example.\" The National Security Council also by law includes the vice president, and meetings are regularly attended by the Secretary of the Treasury and the national security adviser, as well.\n",
              "Who is right? Both, said Dan Mahaffee, director of policy at the Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress.\n",
              "Mahaffee said the members of the group McCain is referring to are generally called the \"principals\" who make up the core of the national security team. But other advisers, including those mentioned by the White House, are often powerful cogs in those meetings as well. President George W. Bush, for example, delegated a lot of national security authority to Vice President Dick Cheney, Mahaffee said, while President Richard Nixon made National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger his point man for those discussions.\n",
              "\"There are two columns you put these people in,\" Mahaffee said. \"The ones empowered by law to give advice, and the larger, more informal staff that is equally if not more weighty in this administration.\"\n",
              "We don’t know what side many of those players fell on during the debate. The White House told us, \"We don’t discuss the details of our internal deliberations.\", \"(Obama) did accept donations from lobbyists and PACs and he spent money in this campaign from that, through his political action committee.\" In a March 16, 2008, interview with a group of college journalists, the mtvU editorial board, former President Bill Clinton was asked why Sen. Hillary Clinton had not made a pledge not to accept campaign contributions from lobbyists, as Sen. Barack Obama has.\n",
              "\"He (Obama) did accept donations from lobbyists and PACs and he spent money in this campaign from that, through his political action committee,\" Bill Clinton said. \"He said one thing and did another.\"\n",
              "Clinton is talking here about Obama's leadership PAC, Hopefund. Leadership PACs are political action committees established by members of Congress to support other candidates.\n",
              "All the other presidential candidates shut down their leadership PACs when they announced their candidacy, but Obama's PAC continued to distribute more than $400,000 to political candidates and parties after Obama entered the ring on Feb. 10, 2007.\n",
              "\"And this money did come from lobbyists and special interest groups,\" Clinton said.\n",
              "Clinton is right, but some scale is in order.\n",
              "According to an analysis for PolitiFact by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, of the $4.5-million raised by Obama's Hopefund, $16,500 came from lobbyists, and $125,000 from political action committees such as Lockheed Martin Employees' PAC, AT&T Corp. PAC and Walt Disney Productions Employees. The biggest donors were lawyers and law firms, accounting for nearly a half-million dollars.\n",
              "So Obama's leadership PAC did raise money from lobbyists and PACs, though it amounted to just a fraction of the total fundraising. Also notable is that the money was collected before Obama announced his presidential candidacy, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n",
              "PolitiFact has already weighed in on Obama's campaign pledge not to take money from lobbyists or PACs, finding that while he has eschewed money from federally registered lobbyists, he has accepted thousands from people who work for lobbying firms. We have also noted that Hillary Clinton has raised more campaign donations from registered lobbyists than any other candidate.\n",
              "Common sense suggests the distributions to candidates were meant to advance Obama's campaign, particularly when almost 43 percent of the money was spent on candidates in states with early primaries. (See our related ruling on this point here).\n",
              "One question is whether Obama's Hopefund distributions violate Obama's pledge not to accept lobbyist or PAC money in his run for president. Because the contributions were made prior to the start of his campaign, we find they do not. Therefore it's a stretch for Clinton to say, \"He said one thing and did another.\"\n",
              "But we're checking Clinton's claim that \"(Obama) did accept donations from lobbyists and PACs and he spent money in this campaign from that, through his political action committee.\" And Obama's leadership PAC did accept $16,000 from lobbyists, and another $125,000 from PACs, even though it was collected before Obama was an announced candidate. And nearly half of Hopefund's money was spent on key primary states during the campaign., \"(Obamacare) is a bill which has never once had a majority of Americans favor it.\" U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, made waves this week with his 21-hour Senate speech against Obamacare. While he’s the only one reading Green Eggs and Ham to his colleagues as a form of protest, he’s far from alone in his criticism of the law.\n",
              "CNN Crossfire host Newt Gingrich referenced public opinion on the Sept. 24, 2013, show while criticizing President Barack Obama’s health care reform.\n",
              "\"It is a bill which has never once had a majority of Americans favor it,\" he said.\n",
              "Gingrich’s claim comes while Congress evaluates Republican-written legislation that proposes funding the government only if Obamacare is defunded.\n",
              "We looked at a similar claim in 2011, but it’s time to dive into the polls again.\n",
              "Since the Affordable Care Act was drafted in 2009, the poll numbers have been more or less consistent across different months and polling organizations: The approval rating has hovered around 40 percent recently, with about 50 percent disapproval and 10 percent no opinion.\n",
              "Not much has changed since then, according to a recent CNN and ORC report of all their Obamacare polling. That’s consistent with Gallup and other polling agencies. As best as we can tell, a credible poll has never turned up a figure over 50 percent.\n",
              "Bigger picture\n",
              "Gingrich was onto something with the poll results, confirmed Larry Jacobs, a University of Minnesota professor who specializes in public opinion and polling.\n",
              "\"It’s one of those things where when you look at the number of polling organizations, the variety of question wordings, I consider that an impressive finding and a robust one,\" Jacobs said.\n",
              "However, there’s a disconnect between the poll results themselves and Gingrich’s implication that most Americans don’t want Obamacare, Jacobs added.\n",
              "Although the poll results are consistent with each other, they produce lower favorability ratings than polls about health care reform that refer to the \"Affordable Care Act\" as opposed to \"Obamacare,\" according to CNBC .\n",
              "That’s because using the president’s name in a poll is \"more likely to invoke a partisan prism for evaluation,\" said Michael Traugott, a University of Michigan professor who specializes in public opinion and polling.\n",
              "In those studies that ask more generally about health care reform, Republicans respond more favorably .\n",
              "When pollsters ask the public about individual elements of Obamacare, like coverage for pre-existing conditions, the majority favors them , Traugott said. The main exception to this rule is the individual mandate.\n",
              "Another caveat to the poll results Gingrich references is the fact that a sizable segment of the public is misinformed or uninformed about the details of Obamacare. In fact, four in 10 polled by the Kaiser Family Foundation in April were unaware that the Affordable Care Act is still law. So many people indicate that they don’t favor Obamacare not because they don’t agree with the policy, but because they don’t understand the policy.\n",
              "\"Low levels of knowledge about the details of the legislation make it unlikely that there would be widespread support for it,\" Traugott said., \"(Palin) supported right-wing extremist Pat Buchanan for president in 2000.\" Gov. Sarah Palin's conservative credentials have excited the GOP base, and perhaps in equal fashion have ignited the passions of liberals.\n",
              "Palin remained Topic A during the Republican National Convention and her resume has been picked over by friends and foes alike. In the foe category would be MoveOn.org, the liberal activist group, which on Sept. 2 sent an e-mail to an estimated 3.2-million supporters, offering their views of Palin's flaws as a public official.\n",
              "One item caught our attention. The e-mail said Palin, Alaska's governor since 2006, \"supported right-wing extremist Pat Buchanan for president in 2000.\"\n",
              "\"This is information the American people need to see,\" the email said. \"Please take a moment to forward this email to your friends and family.\"\n",
              "In making its allegation, Move.on picked up on a charge made by others, most notably Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla., a longtime Barack Obama supporter. The charge relies on a single Associated Press story from July 1999 about Buchanan's campaign stop in tiny Wasilla, Alaska, where Palin was mayor at the time. The article described Palin as \"among those sporting Buchanan buttons.\"\n",
              "We won't delve into the question of whether Buchanan really is a \"right-wing extremist.\" Those are the kinds of judgments voters can make for themselves. But the allegation that Palin was a Buchanan supporter might carry some weight, especially among Jewish voters, many of whom consider him to be anti-Israel. Wexler, in his charge, said Buchanan had \"a uniquely atrocious record on Israel,\" and the Anti-Defamation League calls Buchanan a \"racist, anti-Semite.\"\n",
              "So the question is this: Did Palin support Buchanan in 2000?\n",
              "No. Shortly after Buchanan's visit to Wasilla, and after the AP story, Palin wrote a letter to her local newspaper making clear that her appearance at the Buchanan event wasn't an endorsement of his candidacy. Published July 26, 1999, the letter said:\n",
              "\"As mayor of Wasilla, I am proud to welcome all presidential candidates to our city. This is true regardless of their party, or the latest odds of their winning. When presidential candidates visit our community, I am always happy to meet them. I'll even put on their button when handed one as a polite gesture of respect.\n",
              "\"Though no reporter interviewed me for the Associated Press article on the recent visit by a presidential candidate (Metro, July 17), the article may have left your readers with the perception that I am endorsing this candidate, as opposed to welcoming his visit to Wasilla. As mayor, I will welcome all the candidates in Wasilla.\"\n",
              "Not long after, Wasilla endorsed Steve Forbes' unsuccessful bid for the 2000 GOP nomination.\n",
              "The one complication is that Buchanan appeared on CNBC's Hardball on Aug. 30 and claimed that Palin and her husband had been supporters during is '96 campaign. \"She was a brigadier for me in '96, as was her husband,'' Buchanan said. \"She's a terrific gal. She's a rebel reformer.\" Buchanan called his supporters the Buchanan Brigades.\n",
              "But on Sept. 3, Buchanan told PolitiFact in St. Paul, Minn., that while he knew Palin attended his rally in Wasilla because of press accounts, he did not know if she actually supported him as a candidate in 2000 or previous campaigns. \"I can't confirm anything,'' he said.\n",
              "Campaign finance reports on CQ Moneyline show she never donated money to Buchanan or Forbes.\n",
              "The McCain campaign is emphatic in refuting the charge.\n",
              "\"Governor Palin has never supported Pat Buchanan,\" the McCain campaign said on its \"Stop the Smears'' Web site, and called on Wexler to retract his comments.\n",
              "But Wexler spokesman Josh Rogin said that won't happen.\n",
              "\"Buchanan says she was a supporter,'' Rogin said.\n",
              "Buchanan doesn't say that anymore. We may never be sure of Palin's position in 1996, but if she says she wasn't a Buchanan supporter and Buchanan says he can't prove that she was, we don't have much to go on.\n",
              "But for our purposes, the question of 2000 is more important because that's what Moveon.org alleges in a widespread e-mail. The letter to the editor that Palin wrote back in 1999 seems pretty clear to us. Even back then she wanted to make it clear that Buchanan wasn't her choice for president  in the 2000 race, which leaves us with nowhere to go but False., \"(Paul Ryan) has actually proposed three — total, three — bills that have become law in his entire career dating back to 1999.\" Even after endorsing Donald Trump, House Speaker Paul Ryan continues to wrestle with the divide between him and his party’s presidential nominee.\n",
              "\"We’re different people,\" Ryan, who is from Janesville, told reporters at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. \"There are different kinds of conservatives.\"\n",
              "While Trump appeals to emotions, Ryan tends to be cast as the GOP’s policy wonk.\n",
              "But in a July 9, 2016 New York Times article , the chairman of the University of Wisconsin’s political science department suggested Ryan’s reputation may be overblown.\n",
              "Why? Few of his plans ever become law.\n",
              "\"(Ryan) has actually proposed three — total, three — bills that have become law in his entire career dating back to 1999,\" David Canon was quoted as saying. \"Paul Ryan is not a detail kind of legislator in terms of putting bills together to pass, and he never has been.\n",
              "\"He is an ideas guy.\"\n",
              "When Ryan announced his endorsement of Trump, he wrote that the first step in setting policy agenda is \"putting it on paper and having a real debate.\"\n",
              "In making his claim, Canon suggested Ryan doesn’t follow his own advice — or hasn’t had much success with it. Let’s take a look.\n",
              "Bills, bills, bills\n",
              "The article listed three bills proposed by Ryan that became law:\n",
              "\"One named a post office in Wisconsin, a second changed taxes on arrows used by deer hunters, and the third, this year, established a $3 million presidential commission on ‘evidence-based policy making.’ \"\n",
              "A visit to Ryan’s profile at Congress.gov shows — when filtered by \"Sponsored Legislation\" and \"Became Law\" — the same three bills referenced in the article.\n",
              "While Canon was quoted as saying Ryan proposed only three bills, he told us he was referring to bills \"sponsored\" by Ryan.\n",
              "\"Sponsoring a bill is very different than co-sponsoring a bill,\" Canon wrote in an email. \"Many bills that become law have a hundred or more cosponsors, so bill sponsorship is the meaningful indicator of the member of Congress who had primary influence on determining the content of a bill.\"\n",
              "According to Congress.gov, Ryan has sponsored 109 pieces of legislation and co-sponsored 1,067. Of those, 83 became law.\n",
              "New York Times reporter Jackie Calmes said it was clear from their conversation that Canon was referencing sponsored bills, and the statement’s context in the article reflects that.\n",
              "But Ryan’s camp challenged how Canon assessed Ryan’s tenure.\n",
              "\"Any realistic look at (Ryan’s) record will clearly show the claim that Paul has only passed three bills is objectively wrong,\" said spokesman Ian Martorana.\n",
              "He references three particular items not included in the count, all of which Ryan helped write:\n",
              "Murray-Ryan Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013\n",
              "Trade Promotion Authority legislation in 2015\n",
              "Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, in which Ryan authored disability insurance reforms\n",
              "For four years, Ryan also chaired the House Budget Committee, which wrote and passed a nonbinding resolution each year, Martorana said.\n",
              "Jennifer Victor, a professor of political science at George Mason University and an expert on Congress, said while Ryan has only personally sponsored three bills that became law, bill passage is not necessarily a good indicator of effectiveness as a legislator.\n",
              "\"Some legislators may be very active in a policy area, but rarely see enactment,\" she wrote in an email. \"Think of someone who introduces many bills, perhaps symbolically, and they all die in committee or get voted down on the floor.\"\n",
              "While this legislator hasn’t changed the law, he or she might have generated attention for a topic.\n",
              "Measuring impact based only on the bills a lawmaker solely sponsors also introduces issues, Victor said. Early cosponsors can be heavily involved in the bill’s content and committee chairs, while they don’t necessarily write more bills, often serve as facilitators.\n",
              "A better indicator of effectiveness, Victor said, is a tool developed by two professors that measures a lawmaker relative to his or her peers.\n",
              "It takes into account the content of a lawmaker’s bills and how far the bills moved. Policy bills, for example, increase a lawmaker’s score more than commemorative bills. But it only looks at solely sponsored bills, which does not necessarily give the full picture of a lawmaker’s impact.\n",
              "By this tool, Ryan comes off as more effective, though his effectiveness is below the benchmark expectation for all but one two-year period since 1999.\n",
              "The expectation is calculated based on his party, tenure and specific committee and subcommittee positions he has held., \"(Pete) Sessions has held at least two fundraisers at adult-themed clubs and made no apologies.\" Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, has been getting flak after the RNC reimbursed a staffer some $2,000 spent at a risque club in Los Angeles.\n",
              "So why, asks the Democrat-backing Lone Star Project, is U.S. Rep. Pete Sessions of Dallas, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, off the hook for \"his fundraising at Las Vegas strip clubs?\"\n",
              "The Lone Star Project is steered by Matt Angle, director of the Texas Democratic Trust and former aide to then-U.S. Rep. Martin Frost, D-Dallas, whom Sessions beat in 2004. On its Web site, the group says it's an arm of the Lone Star Fund political action committee, offering \"political and legislative analysis to help individuals, organizations and the press see beyond the rhetoric and misinformation typically provided by the current Republican state leadership in Texas and Texas Republicans in Washington.\"\n",
              "\"Sessions has held at least two fundraisers at adult-themed clubs and made no apologies,\" according to an April 8 press release from the group.\n",
              "In the wake of the RNC's recent brouhaha, we wondered if Angle & Company bared the truth about Sessions' events.\n",
              "As back-up to his claim, Angle pointed us to a video attached to the press release. The video, made and uploaded to YouTube this month by the Lone Star Project, shows scenes from Forty Deuce, a Las Vegas club where Sessions has previously confirmed he held an event in 2007 to raise money for his political committee, Pete PAC, which gives money to Republican political candidates. The PAC spent more than $5,000 to rent the club for the occasion, according to federal finance disclosures.\n",
              "Included with the video: A sound clip from the American Public Media radio show Marketplace. On the clip, Sessions says: \"We do a Las Vegas fundraiser every year, and uh, not only raise money, but see Las Vegas. It's a beautiful town.\"\n",
              "Marketplace reporter Steve Henn replies: \"Forty Deuce is a strip club.\"\n",
              "According to the clip, Sessions says: \"You know, I've never seen that. It is what I would call a burlesque show, where there's a woman who comes out and has a dress on... uh, she never gets naked. There's no nudity, there's no nudity in there.\"\n",
              "According to an undated promotional advertisement for Forty Deuce, the club calls itself a \"World-Famous Burlesque,\" with \"striptease that is very empowering to women\" and \"appeals to both sexes.\" The original Forty Deuce opened in Los Angeles in 2002 and closed in 2008. The Las Vegas Forty Deuce venue in the Mandalay Bay casino was open from 2004 to 2007. Since 2008, the Forty Deuce show has played Friday nights at its new Hollywood venue.\n",
              "Lana Gates, events director for Forty Deuce and other Kane ventures, told us \"there is no nudity in the show — it's a mix of sexiness and whimsy, pleasing to both genders.\"\n",
              "In the Marketplace segment, Kane offered this distinction about his burlesque shows: \"The key component would be to have girls who were dancers taking their clothes off, not just girls taking their clothes off.\"\n",
              "Promotional video of Forty Deuce's scantily-clad dancers crawling across the floor and grinding on musicians indicated the show is adult-oriented, as the Lone Star Project says. Published reports reinforce that conclusion. In 2002, The New York Times wrote of the Forty Deuce in Los Angeles: \"The dancer, Carolina Cerisola, gyrated and fox-trotted while peeling off her gown, a pair of long violet gloves and a pink bra. When she kicked off a pair of spangled black panties, they grazed the back of the bartender's head.\" And writing in The New York Times' travel section, Frommer's Travel Guides describes the Las Vegas joint as \"the first establishment to cash in on the return of the high-class hoochie girl.\" Zagat, on its Web site, calls it \"good for a bachelor party.\"\n",
              "Unnoted by the Lone Star Project: Sessions raised money for his leadership PAC, People for Enterprise, Trade and Economic Growth (PETE), at the Forty Deuce club before he was elected by House Republicans in November 2008 to lead the NRCC. So, unlike GOP chairman Steele, he did not yet hold a national party post.\n",
              "The second fundraiser cited by the Lone Star Project, also for Sessions' PAC, took place at Tao Las Vegas in February 2009. The Tao complex includes an Asian-cuisine restaurant, topless pool and nightclub (the club promises \"a happy ending\" on its Vegas billboards).\n",
              "The Washington Post reported that unnamed Republicans had said the 2009 fundraiser was held at Tao's restaurant, which, according to Restaurants & Institutions magazine, ranked as the highest-grossing independent restaurant in the United States — a title it still claims today. According to federal financial disclosures, Sessions' PAC spent about $4,390 on food and beverages at the restaurant.\n",
              "What we found: The restaurant is two floors down from Tao's nightclub, which has nearly nude dancers that restaurant patrons 21 and older can go upstairs to see. Pennapa Chutima, a hostess at the restaurant, said it's not adult-themed. She said: \"It's a peaceful calm environment. Families are more than welcome. We are stroller-friendly.\"\n",
              "The city of Las Vegas classifies local clubs as topless clubs with liquor, adult night club establishments or as nightclubs. Tao's club — which doesn't have burlesque or striptease — is listed among nightclubs.\n",
              "Finally, we didn't find record of Sessions airing fundraising regrets. Neither Sessions nor his aides agreed to our requests for on-the-record interviews.\n",
              "The naked truth?\n",
              "All indications are that Sessions held one fundraiser in an adult-themed venue and another in a restaurant that's separated from its nightclub featuring nearly nude dancers., \"(President Barack Obama gave) half a billion in taxpayer money to help his friends at Solyndra, a business the White House knew was on the path to bankruptcy.\" A new TV ad airing in Florida and other states portrays President Barack Obama as a politician who showered millions of taxpayer dollars on \"his friends at Solyndra,\" a once-hot solar company now in bankruptcy court.\n",
              "Americans for Prosperity, a group that works closely with tea party activists and has been funded by the conservative Koch family, released the ad, which uses news clips and e-mail snippets to support an ominous voiceover:\n",

              "\"What does Obama give them in return? Half a billion in taxpayer money to help his friends at Solyndra, a business the White House knew was on the path to bankruptcy. But loaned them the money anyway .\n",

              "Solyndra, based in Silicon Valley, formed in 2005 with a blockbuster idea: a unique type of solar cell, cylinders that didn't require pricey silicon, which promised to make them cheaper than their rivals.\n",
              "In 2006, the U.S. Department of Energy invited the company to apply for a new loan guarantee program, a program created with the support of a majority of Republicans , who controlled Congress at the time.\n",
              "The company's December 2006 pre-application was enough to vault it into a group of 16 applicants invited to submit full applications in 2007. By early January 2009, Solyndra's file had been reviewed by the department's credit committee and returned with a request for further analysis. On Jan. 15, the loan program office said \"due diligence\" for the Solyndra loan was scheduled to be complete by March 2009. The money was going to build a gleaming new factory in Fremont, Calif.\n",
              "Obama took office Jan. 20, 2009, and one of his first legislative achievements was a major economic stimulus package. The administration pushed to finish the $535 million loan for Solyndra so it could tout the company as a poster child of the stimulus — construction jobs plus a boost to American green energy. Solyndra got the loan Sept. 3, 2009.\n",
              "As recently as 2010, the company was hailed as a Silicon Valley superstar, ranked a top clean-tech company by the Wall Street Journal and one of the \" World's 50 Most Innovative Companies \" by a Massachusetts Institute of Technology magazine.\n",
              "But subsidized Chinese solar panels got even cheaper as the price of silicon plummeted — along with Solyndra's chances for becoming profitable. Red flags multiplied by February 2011, and the government restructured the loan to rescue the factory project.\n",
              "Still, Solyndra collapsed spectacularly in August 2011. Factory employees who worked late the night before , as they often did, found their jobs had evaporated the following morning — with no notice and no severance. An FBI raid followed. Solyndra filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Sept. 6, 2011.\n",
              "Solyndra had fallen far and fast. Its unique solar cells had once attracted more than $1 billion from private investors. Now taxpayers could lose hundreds of millions of dollars.\n",
              "Friends of Barack?\n",
              "The Americans for Prosperity ad says Obama helped \"his friends at Solyndra.\" So, who owns Solyndra?\n",
              "Four venture capital firms own nearly 70 percent of the company, according to bankruptcy filings . Argonaut Ventures owns the largest stake, with nearly 40 percent, while Madrone Partners own 13 percent. Two others own about 9 percent and 7 percent.\n",
              "Who was the ad talking about? The ad's fine print refers to a Daily Caller article headlined \" Bankrupt solar company with fed backing has cozy ties to Obama admin .\"\n",
              "The story focused on \"shareholders and executives\" of Solyndra who \"fundraised for and donated to the Obama administration to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars.\" The largest contributor listed in the story: George Kaiser, who raised $50,000 to $100,000 for Obama's campaign. (For a little context, in the big-money world of presidential fundraising, he's among 560 elite fundraisers for Obama, though not in the top tier who gathered upwards of half a million each.)\n",
              "Kaiser, though, is neither a shareholder nor an executive of Solyndra. The Tulsa, Okla., oil billionaire is the donor behind the George Kaiser Family Foundation . The foundation focuses on poverty, community health, civic enhancement — and national energy policy. (Its National Energy Policy Institute is \"an effort to establish a rational energy policy that will effectively reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil.\") The foundation, rather than hire an outside financial adviser to handle its investments, does it mostly in-house, through a subsidiary. That subsidiary is Argonaut Ventures, the largest investor in Solyndra.\n",
              "Kaiser isn't on the foundation's board or Argonaut's or Solyndra's. (And for the record, his foundation is unrelated to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation , which focuses on the health care system and national health care reform.)\n",
              "It's important to note here that Kaiser was never in a position to profit from Solyndra — his contributions to his foundation are \"irretractable.\"\n",
              "\"He could not withdraw money from the foundation for his private use,\" said C. Renzi Stone, a spokesman for the foundation. \"So that money is there forever. ... The investment in Solyndra would not have benefited Mr. Kaiser personally in any way.\"\n",
              "A handful of other executives affiliated with Solyndra's management and board donated to the Obama campaign or other Democrats over the years, according to the Daily Caller story. But others didn't reach the level of Kaiser's fundraising — which Stone said could be traced to a single fundraiser at Kaiser's Tulsa home in 2007.\n",
              "Meanwhile, Madrone Partners, which owns more than 10 percent of Solyndra, is an investment vehicle for another family — the Waltons of Walmart fame. While some argue that Walmart is no longer a conservative company that focuses solely on GOP causes, a search of Federal Election Commission records for contributions from people who list Madrone as an employer still shows most cash benefited GOP recipients. General partner Gregory Penner, for example, a Walton in-law, gave primarily to Republicans, such as $5,000 to the Senate Conservatives Fund, $10,000 to the Republican Party of Kentucky and $10,000 to McCain Victory 2008. He also made smaller contributions to a handful of Democrats such as U.S. Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska.\n",
              "House Republicans investigate\n",
              "The Republican-controlled House Energy and Commerce Committee has been investigating since February 2011 how close ties may have been between Solyndra and the Obama administration. Its Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee held hearings in July, September and October, and has been collecting documents and correspondence, including from the White House.\n",
              "So far, the subcommittee's work has generated more than 85,000 pages of documents, according to the White House .\n",
              "The committee members have pointed to e-mails that show the Obama administration was eager to confirm Solyndra's loan so the president and vice president could tout it as a stimulus success story. \"Can you confirm whether there are any issues regarding a closing on Sept. 3 for a Sept. 4 VP event on Solyndra? This implies we will need to wrap up our review/approval by Sept. 1,\" said one Energy Department e-mail from late August. Other e-mail shows that Steve Mitchell, Argonaut's managing director who also served on Solyndra's board, and Ken Levit, the executive director of the George Kaiser Family Foundation, exchanged messages with George Kaiser about Solyndra and the White House.\n",
              "Kaiser visited Obama's White House at least 16 times to chat about energy policy, according to the Daily Caller and  Tulsa World , but the foundation told reporters that Solyndra's loan never came up.\n",
              "Spokesman Stone repeated in November: \"To reaffirm our previous public statements, George Kaiser had no discussions with the government regarding the loan to Solyndra.\"\n",
              "But messages released by House Republicans on Nov. 9, 2011 include this one from Kaiser to Mitchell, copied to Levit:\n",
              "\"A couple of weeks ago when Ken and I were visited with a group of administration folks in D.C. who are in charge of the stimulus process (White House, not DOE) and Solyndra came up, every one of them responded simultaneously about their thorough knowledge of the Solyndra story, suggesting it was one of their prime poster children,\" Kaiser wrote in March 2010.\n",
              "Did they talk about the loan? It's not clear.\n",
              "Meanwhile, in the same batch of e-mails, they discuss that they don't expect to leverage their White House relationships for special treatment.  Mitchell noted to Kaiser and Levit, \"I think the company is hoping that we have some unnatural relationship that can open bigger doors — I've cautioned them that no one really has those relationships anymore.\"\n",
              "The path to bankruptcy\n",
              "So did the administration know Solyndra was \"on the path to bankruptcy\"?\n",
              "The ad suggests that the Energy Department thought Solyndra would run short on cash as it built its new factory but approved the loan anyway, pointing to e-mail messages released by the House subcommittee. Those messages, written in August 2009 as the department was drafting the final loan terms, got into details about the project's \"cash balance\" and \"working capital requirements.\" The loan guarantee was formally issued on Sept. 3, 2009. House Democrats responded to this idea in September, saying that \"a career agency official who served in the Bush administration\" had responded to the concern raised on those messages. That official's e-mail, also from August, said that equity investors, who had already pumped over $1 billion into the company, wouldn't let a short-term cash crunch keep Solyndra from finishing its project.\n",
              "And in fact when Solyndra later restructured its Energy Department loan, private investors did throw in $75 million to keep the company on track. (Of course, that's the subject of its own uproar: The terms of the deal put that $75 million loan ahead of taxpayers' investment. House Republicans say that was illegal; Energy Department lawyers had cleared it at the time.)\n",
              "The idea of the loan guarantee program was to push technology from research and development into commercial production — an inherently risky process. Energy Department officials questioned whether Solyndra had the cash to complete its factory project but concluded private investors would continue to bankroll the company. That's rather different from the ad's claim of political favoritism.\n",
              "The sky-high price of high-grade silicon, one of the keys to marketing Solyndra's silicon-free design, dove from almost $1,000 a pound in early 2008 to less than $100 a pound a year later, according to the Los Angeles Times. That left its technology much more expensive than competing flat panels, and paved the way for its struggle to survive. Solyndra argued, the Times reported, that it just needed time to get its prices down. But it never did catch up.\n",
              "Autumn Hanna of Taxpayers for Common Sense has been highly critical of the loan guarantee program since it started in 2005. She noted the program — backed by both Republicans and Democrats over the years — had \"too few protections for taxpayers and too little rules governing the decision making.\" (The Government Accountability Office raised similar concerns in 2008 and 2010 .)\n",
              "\"This was a recipe for fiscal disaster, and Solyndra will likely be just the tip of the iceberg,\" she said., \"(President Barack Obama) said unemployment was never gonna go over 8 percent if we passed the stimulus plan.\" When Gov. Chris Christie began his interview Sunday on CBS News’ \"Face the Nation,\" host Bob Schieffer said he enjoys having him on the show, because the Republican governor has an unusual habit of answering questions.\n",
              "But with one of those answers, Christie rehashed an old -- and mostly inaccurate -- GOP talking point about President Barack Obama guaranteeing that the stimulus program would keep unemployment below 8 percent.\n",
              "With the next round of Republican primaries set for Tuesday in Arizona and Michigan, Christie continued on Sunday making his pitch that GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney would ultimately prevail and take on Obama in the Nov. 6 general election.\n",
              "Obama will be a very formidable candidate, but the president still has weaknesses, according to Christie.\n",
              "\"He said unemployment was never gonna go over 8 percent if we passed the stimulus plan,\" Christie told Schieffer. \"We went up over 10 percent.\"\n",
              "PolitiFact National and its state affiliates have debunked similar claims several times before, starting with U.S. Rep. Eric Cantor (R-Virginia) in July 2009. More recently, Romney faced the Truth-O-Meter for repeating that statement earlier this month after winning the Nevada caucuses.\n",
              "Each time, the claim has received a Mostly False.\n",
              "Here’s what the fact-checks have revealed:\n",
              "The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, better known as the stimulus, was signed into law on Feb. 17, 2009. The stimulus was meant to dole out billions of dollars as a way to boost the economy.\n",
              "The nation’s unemployment rate stood at 8.3 percent in February 2009 and gradually increased before peaking at 10 percent in October 2009, according to seasonally-adjusted data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate has since decreased to 8.3 percent as of last month.\n",
              "But PolitiFact has never found evidence of an administration official making a public pledge to hold unemployment below 8 percent.\n",
              "The source of the Republican claims is a Jan. 9, 2009 report from Christina Romer, who would soon become chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, who would serve as chief economist and economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden.\n",
              "The purpose of the study was to estimate the potential effects of a stimulus program on job creation. Romer and Bernstein estimated that the recovery package would create between 3 million and 4 million jobs by the end of 2010.\n",
              "On one chart, they estimated the unemployment rates both with and without the stimulus plan.\n",
              "Without the stimulus, the unemployment rate was projected to top 9 percent in early 2010, the report states. With the stimulus, the unemployment rate would peak at just under 8 percent in 2009, according to the report.\n",
              "But throughout the report, the authors cautioned that their estimates are subject to significant \"uncertainty.\"\n",
              "Check out this passage from the report:\n",
              "\"It should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error. There is the obvious uncertainty that comes from modeling a hypothetical package rather than the final legislation passed by the Congress. But, there is the more fundamental uncertainty that comes with any estimate of the effects of a program.\n",
              "\"Our estimates of economic relationships and rules of thumb are derived from historical experience and so will not apply exactly in any given episode. Furthermore, the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity.\"\n",
              "So, the claim about unemployment not exceeding 8 percent was a projection subject to \"uncertainty,\" and far from the guarantee suggested by Christie and other Republicans.\n",
              "The governor's office did not respond to an email seeking comment., \"(Romney's) record was that he raised taxes by $730-million.\" Not willing to concede the True Tax Conservative mantle to Mitt Romney, John McCain reiterated in a Jan. 30, 2008, debate a claim he has made frequently about Romney's tax record as governor of Massachusetts.\n",
              "\"His (Romney's) record was that he raised taxes by $730-million,\" McCain said.\n",
              "Bill Clinton once famously said, \"It depends upon what the meaning of the word 'is' is.\" Here, it depends upon what the meaning of \"taxes\" is.\n",
              "Romney says he never raised taxes. And in fact, he never raised the state income tax or sales tax rates as governor of Massachusetts. We addressed a related claim by Romney in a TV ad here.\n",
              "But he did raise \"fees.\" And he did make changes to tax codes to close \"loopholes\" that resulted in some businesses having to pay more taxes.\n",
              "Here was Romney's take on McCain's charge during the Republican debate:\n",
              "\"Now, why did we raise fees $240-million? We had a $3-billion budget shortfall, we decided we were not going to raise taxes, and we found that some fees hadn't been raised in as many as 20 years. These were not broad-based fees for things like getting your driver's license or your license plate for your car, but instead something like the cost of a sign on the interstate and how much it was going to cost to publish a McDonald's or a Burger King sign on the interstate. We went from, like, $200 a sign to $2,000 a sign to raise money for our state in a way that was consistent with the what the market had done over the ensuing years.\"\n",
              "Romney also raised fees for getting married, buying a house, bringing a case to court and using a public golf course.\n",
              "The amount raised by the increased fees is a matter of some dispute. Romney said during the debate that they came to just $240-million (previously, Romney has said the fees came to $260-million. It's unclear if he simply misspoke.). In a lengthy analysis of Romney's gubernatorial record, the Boston Globe said the $260-million, raised in 2004, ignores at least $71-million in new fees implemented shortly after Romney took office. In a 2006 fiscal policy report card on America's governors, the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, estimated the cost of the fees at $500-million and gave Romney a C.\n",
              "So when is a fee actually a tax? According to some tax groups, it's when the cost of a fee exceeds the cost of services rendered.\n",
              "Romney noted that the impetus for increasing fees was to pay down some of the massive debt he inherited as governor. So presumably some of the increased fees were used to subsidize unrelated parts of the budget. But other fees were simply antiquated.\n",
              "Said McCain: \"He called them 'fees.' I'm sure the people that had to pay it, whether they called them bananas, they still had to pay $730-million extra.\"\n",
              "While McCain's campaign did not return calls for clarification, it appears McCain was referring not just to fees, but also to some corporate tax \"loopholes\" Massachusetts closed while Romney was governor.\n",
              "Some of them require a degree in accounting to follow.\n",
              "According to a Massachusetts Department of Revenue report, the \"loophole\" changes have brought the state an additional $377-million.\n",
              "\"The governor at the time tried to say he was eliminating tax loopholes, not increasing taxes,\" said Michael Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation. \"But it's not in dispute that he raised taxes on corporations. We don't see it as 'closing loopholes.' \"\n",
              "Romney was a Republican governor with a Democrat-controlled state legislature. For three years, he proposed cutting the sales tax from 5.3 percent to 5 percent, and all three times, he was rebuffed by the legislature. He was able to secure a one-time $250-million capital gains tax rebate.\n",
              "But was McCain right, did Romney raise taxes $730-million? Depends on what your definition of \"taxes\" is. If you include fees and the elimination of corporate tax loopholes, McCain is at least close to accurate.\n",
              "Here's the math: You take $377-million from closing the so-called corporate tax loopholes and add at least $260-million from fees (Romney's calculation). That puts the total at $637-million. Other estimates on the fees — $500-million, according to the Cato Institute — would put the total well above $730-million.\n",
              "The elimination of corporate tax \"loopholes\" clearly resulted in some businesses paying more taxes and to those businesses, fair or not, it sure must have felt like a tax increase. As for fees, it's nearly impossible to measure with precision how much of the increases were appropriate or simply a revenue-generating measure., \"(Ronald Reagan) raised taxes a billion dollars in his first year as governor of California.\" As the candidates fell over themselves in a game of I-loved-Ronald Reagan one-upsmanship during a Jan. 10, 2008, debate in South Carolina, Mike Huckabee had the audacity to note that in Reagan's first year as governor of California, the Gipper raised taxes. A lot.\n",
              "\"You know, if Ronald Reagan were running tonight, there would be ads by the Club for Growth running against him because he raised taxes a billion dollars in his first year as governor of California,\" Huckabee said. \"It would be $10-billion today.\"\n",
              "Ronald \"Send the welfare bums back to work\" Reagan?\n",
              "\"Basically, yeah,\" said Kelly Barton, an archivist at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif.\n",
              "In the summer of 1967, during Reagan's first year as governor, and contrary to his campaign promises, Reagan signed off on a record tax increase for the state of California — an 18 percent, roughly $1-billion hike.\n",
              "According to Reagan biographer Lou Cannon, the increase included boosting sales taxes from three to five cents on the dollar; raising the maximum income tax from 7 to 10 percent; and increases in bank, corporation, inheritance, liquor and cigarette taxes.\n",
              "A little context is in order. In his autobiography, An American Life, Reagan said he inherited a $200-million deficit from his predecessor, Pat Brown. Reagan ordered a hiring freeze and other spending cuts.\n",
              "But Reagan was a Republican governor in a state where the legislature was controlled by the Democrats, and he wasn't able to muster support for additional cuts. So, he ended up reluctantly signing off on the tax increases.\n",
              "This is the second time in week that a Republican candidate has used Reagan to defend himself. In a debate on Jan. 5, 2008, Rudy Giuliani correctly pointed out that Reagan had endorsed a policy of amnesty for some illegal aliens. Read our ruling here.\n",
              "Now, Huckabee's math may be a little off on what that $1-billion would translate to today. It's actually closer to $6.3-billion.\n",
              "But the bottom line, Huckabee's statement about Reagan is true., \"(Sen. Robert) Gordon cost us money, exempting the Newark sports arena from paying property taxes and sticking us with the bill.\" The Prudential Center in Newark is not in his legislative district or even one of the counties he's looking to represent in Trenton, but Republican State Senate candidate John Driscoll Jr. wants voters in parts of Bergen and Passaic counties to know the arena doesn’t pay property taxes.\n",
              "For that exemption, Driscoll says voters can blame his opponent in the Nov. 8 general election, Democratic incumbent Robert Gordon.\n",
              "Looking to unseat Gordon in the 38th Legislative District, Driscoll, a Bergen County freeholder, recently put out a television ad lambasting the senator for allegedly raising taxes and chasing away jobs from Bergen County.\n",
              "With cash flying from the image of a family superimposed over a photo of the Prudential Center, the narrator intones: \"Gordon cost us money, exempting the Newark sports arena from paying property taxes and sticking us with the bill.\"\n",
              "PolitiFact New Jersey found that Gordon did vote in 2008 to exempt the Newark Housing Authority, which owns the arena, from paying property taxes there. But that property tax exemption did not have a direct effect on voters in Bergen and Passaic counties, who are the target audience for the ad.\n",
              "First, let’s explain the property tax exemption.\n",
              "Gordon was one of 21 senators -- the minimum needed for passage -- to vote for a bill in 2008 exempting projects like the Prudential Center from paying property taxes. The bill was later signed into law by former Gov. Jon Corzine.\n",
              "Without such an exemption, the authority would have had to pay $6 million in property taxes to the city, authority attorney Paul Sangillo said at the time.\n",
              "So, Driscoll’s ad is right that Gordon supported an exemption for the Prudential Center, which means the city does not receive property tax revenues from the arena property. Otherwise, those tax revenues would go to the city, its school district and Essex County.\n",
              "In a statement, Newark spokeswoman Anne Torres said the tax exemption is appropriate, because the arena property is publicly owned. The authority collects rent at the arena on behalf of the city, Torres said.\n",
              "\"If the property were not exempt, the NHA would likely have to expend federal or state funding or in other words ‘tax dollars’ to afford the taxes on the property,\" according to the statement. \"Without revisiting the original ownership structure, the exemption from that view potentially saved tax dollars.\"\n",
              "Former New Jersey Deputy Attorney General Robert Blau, who has an extensive background in real estate matters, also noted the impact of other tax revenue, such as sales taxes: \"There are certainly other taxes that Newark gets because of the existence of the center. It’s not just lost property taxes.\"\n",
              "OK, so Newark is not receiving property taxes from the arena property, but the ad claims the exemption \"cost us money.\" Who is \"us?\"\n",
              "Driscoll spokesman Greg Volpe said \"us\" refers to taxpayers, and pointed to news articles showing that Newark has needed additional state aid both before and after that exemption was granted.\n",
              "\"The special exemption for (the) Newark Arena cost the city's bottom line millions of dollars in recurring revenue,\" Volpe said in an email. \"State Legislators were wrong to exempt one of Newark's revenue assets and the result is state taxpayers, including those in the 38th District, have continued to pick up the bill.\"\n",
              "But the ad doesn’t mention those additional state aid awards, giving viewers the impression that \"bill\" refers to the property tax exemption alone. The absence of those property tax payments only has a direct impact on Newark, its school district and Essex County.\n",
              "\"I’m not aware of any rationale by which it could be said that a Newark local property tax exemption could be said to impact taxpayers outside of Essex County,\" Joseph Ragno, an attorney with extensive experience in tax abatements, said in an email., \"(Stimulus money) went to critically important projects like studying ants in Africa.\" A new TV ad by a Republican-aligned advocacy group starts by taking aim at Democratic U.S. senate candidate Tim Kaine, but then veers off onto on an unusual topic: African ant research.\n",
              "The ad from Crossroads Grassroots Policy Studies features Kaine talking about how the 2009 federal stimulus was important to getting people back to work.\n",
              "The ad then gives short shrift to the stimulus, saying it funded things like \"studying ants in Africa,\" a project that the ad says cost $1.9 million.\n",
              "PolitiFact Virginia has found numerous times that stimulus did indeed save or create many jobs nationwide -- including thousands of positions at school divisions across Virginia.\n",
              "But did the stimulus really provide $1.9 million for African ant research? We couldn’t resist checking this one.\n",
              "Some political attacks are recycled year after year, and the ants analogy is one of them.\n",
              "Our colleagues at PolitiFact Oregon examined the backstory behind the ants research in a Sept. 17, 2010 article.  The story noted the stimulus bill doesn’t even mention the words \"ants\" and didn’t directly pay for the ant research, but added that the stimulus legislation gave $3 billion to the National Science Foundation, which in turn decided which projects to fund. The ant research of the Southwest Indian Ocean and East Africa was one of them.\n",
              "Brian Fisher, the project’s leader and curator of entomology at the California Academy of Sciences, told PolitiFact Oregon that ants offer insight into climate change, the spread of disease and natural disasters. He also said the project helped employ 16 people.\n",
              "PolitiFact Oregon was weighing in on a claim that Democratic Senator Ron Wyden voted for $2 million in ant research because he voted in favor of the stimulus. That was ruled False because when Wyden voted for the bill, the ant research wasn’t yet funded by the measure. The stimulus sent money to the National Science Foundation, which funded the ant project later on.\n",
              "But the Crossroads ad we’re examining words its ant claim a bit differently. The latest claim said that stimulus money went to study ants in Africa.\n",
              "That is indeed where the money ended up going. Nate Hodson, a spokesman for Crossroads GPS, said pointed to the National Science Foundation synopsis of the project, which shows that the stimulus put $1.9 million towards the 5-year ant research project.\n",
              "Still, political ads often cite eye-catching facts without providing much context.\n",
              "We weren’t able to reach Fisher for an update on how things are going a year later, but we did speak with Philip Ward, an entomology professor at the University of California at Davis, who is also taking part in the research project.\n",
              "Ward said the project has a number of benefits. First is the scientific pursuit of gaining a better understanding of the organisms on the planet, he said.\n",
              "The research could have an economic benefit by helping find ways to deal with invasive pest ants, Ward said. He noted that one such pest ant, commonly called the Big Headed Ant, is believed to originate from Africa and is a nuisance in Hawaii and Florida.\n",
              "\"Some ants are pest ants, and to better understand and better control pest ants, you need to understand where they come from like where they organize, what their ecology is like in their original range, and what natural enemies they have,\" Ward said., \"(Strickland) raised taxes last year to the tune of $840 million.\" Over the past month of their hotly contested race for governor, Republican challenger John Kasich has accused Gov. Ted Strickland of raising taxes on Ohioans, a charge the Democratic governor has vehemently denied.\n",
              "Kasich has leveled the tax hike charge in his public speeches, during both gubernatorial debates and in campaign commercials. He says the governor’s decision last December to halt a scheduled 2009 income tax cut essentially took away $844 million in refunds earmarked for Ohioans and instead gave it to the government.\n",
              "A television ad from the Republican Governor’s Association released this month features still photographs of Strickland with a woman speaking: \"Ted Strickland promised not to raise taxes. He broke that promise.\"\n",
              "Strickland says he didn’t raise taxes, he only temporarily froze a planned income tax cut to fill an unexpected budget hole. Strickland’s running mate Yvette McGee Brown certainly feels comfortable with that explanation.\n",
              "\"They had the nerve to say, the Republican Governor’s Association, that this governor (Strickland) raised taxes $800 million on Ohioans. Not true,\" Brown said during a rally on Sept. 27 in Cleveland with Strickland standing behind her. \"And I wish PolitiFact would go check that.\"\n",
              "So, we are.\n",
              "The tax issue Kasich is referencing is Strickland’s decision last year to halt the final year of a five-year, 21-percent across-the-board income tax cut that started in 2005. The move saved the state approximately $840 million, money the governor used to fill a budget hole. The only alternative, Strickland insists, was to cut the equivalent amount of cash out of primary and secondary education.\n",
              "Strickland is careful to characterize his move as having frozen the final year of that tax cut and not having eliminated it altogether. The difference: what’s frozen can be thawed and used, but it might not be possible to replicate what has been completely erased.\n",
              "\"We have cut the state income tax 17 percent since 2005,\" Strickland said during his Oct. 7 debate against Kasich, taking credit for the first four years of the tax cuts. Strickland became governor in January 2007.\n",
              "And the governor notes that the postponed final year tax cut is scheduled to be reinstated next year after the current budget cycle expires. Also, the decision to freeze the tax cut required legislative approval, which means the Republican-controlled Ohio Senate had to OK the deal and it did — narrowly.\n",
              "But having received the first four years of the tax cut, Ohioans were already looking forward to the final year, 4.2 percent reduction, Kasich said, until the governor snatched it away.\n",
              "\"He raised taxes last year to the tune of $840 million,\" Kasich said on Oct. 4 during a press conference at the Ohio Republican Party headquarters.\n",
              "To be fair, Strickland had to find a source of revenue or would have had to slash programs. Ohio law requires the state budget be balanced. And part of the reason for the shortfall can be pinned on Republicans, who increased spending in seven consecutive budgets while they controlled the General Assembly while also cutting taxes .\n",
              "And the truth is Ohioans didn’t pay any more in taxes for 2009 over what they paid in 2008, and maybe less once you factor in some inflationary indexing. So, this was not a tax hike in that sense, which Kasich concedes.\n",
              "But he argues it is an increase when residents are forced to pay more in taxes than they had been promised, or to look at it another way, get back less in their state income tax refund than they anticipated.\n",
              "Those who owed the state after filing their 2009 taxes, owed a little bit extra thanks to Strickland’s tax freeze. Strickland’s decision cost a family of four earning $60,000 a year about $78 last year.\n",
              "Strickland prides himself on having made tough decisions in rough economic times. One of those decisions was postponing the income tax cut which meant taking money out of the pockets of Ohioans.\n",
              "But while the freeze is expected to be lifted next year, there are no guarantees that will happen in what is still a rough economic landscape for Ohio. And state taxpayers, who had to pay more in income taxes than what had been promised, may continue to pay at the higher rate., \"(T)he United States government and its Constitution says that people can be put to death.\" Former President Jimmy Carter, in preparation for a conference in Atlanta, recently gave an interview in which he highlighted his opposition to the death penalty.\n",
              "\"The Carter Center and I personally are very deeply opposed to the death penalty,\" he told Time magazine. \"But when the United States government and its Constitution says that people can be put to death, that sets an example of extreme violence that very few other developed, industrialized nations would have.\"\n",
              "With all of the debate about capital punishment in recent years, PolitiFact Georgia wondered if the former president was correct about the Constitution and the death penalty.\n",
              "Carter, a Democrat, gave the interview in advance of the Mobilizing Faith for Women conference, which was scheduled from June 27-29 at his Presidential Center in Atlanta. The conference focused on improving the lives of women around the world. The Carter Center’s website says prior conferences have helped combat issues such as human trafficking and sexual violence. Carter, a former Georgia governor, was scheduled as a speaker.\n",
              "Carter cites the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution for his argument that the death penalty should be considered unconstitutional, said Deanna Congileo, a spokeswoman for Carter. There’s plenty of debate about what that amendment says about the Constitution, which we’ll visit later in this article. As for whether the U.S. government says people can be put to death, there’s a long history of federal executions.\n",
              "There have been 37 federal prisoners executed since 1927, according to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons. The most notable U.S. execution took place in June 2001, when Timothy McVeigh, convicted of the 1995 Oklahoma City federal building bombing that killed 168 people, was executed by lethal injection in a federal prison in Indiana. The last federal execution was in 2003.\n",
              "U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has authorized several death penalty prosecutions since he took office in 2009. In 2011, he revised some procedures on how federal prosecutors can consider death penalty cases.\n",
              "Now, does the Constitution say people can be put to death? There’s healthy legal debate among scholars and jurists concerning that argument.\n",
              "The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution says no one can be held for a capital crime \"except by due process of law.\" Death penalty proponents say that language confirms its legality. Capital punishment opponents contend the words \"cruel and unusual punishments inflicted\" in the Eighth Amendment is an indictment of the death penalty and its legality.\n",
              "The state of Georgia has been the genesis for many of the questions concerning whether the Constitution allows the death penalty, with two landmark U.S. Supreme Court rulings, one occurring when Carter was elected president in 1976.\n",
              "In the 1972 case, Furman v. Georgia, the Supreme Court concluded that the arbitrary application of the death penalty and the disproportionate number of minorities that were executed made the death penalty \"unusual.\" By declining to rule that capital punishment was unconstitutional in and of itself, however, the Supreme Court left the door open for state legislatures to draw more narrowly construed death penalty statutes.\n",
              "In 1976, Georgia's newly written death penalty statute was challenged before the Supreme Court in Gregg v. Georgia. This time, Georgia won. The Supreme Court ruled the death penalty could be used under careful conditions.\n",
              "The website ProCon.org highlights the dispute. It contains a quote from former U.S. Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan disagreeing with the Gregg v. Georgia ruling, saying it violated the Eighth Amendment. Brennan later expressed his moral objections to the death penalty. Next to Brennan’s quote on the website is a quote from the current chief justice, John G. Roberts Jr. In a 2008 ruling, Roberts wrote that a method of execution \"cannot be viewed as probative of the wanton infliction of pain under the Eighth Amendment.\"\n",
              "To sum up, Carter claimed the federal government and the U.S. Constitution say people can be put to death. The U.S. attorney general’s office has guidelines on prosecuting such cases, and the Supreme Court has ruled capital punishment can be employed under the Constitution, although there is still much discussion about its interpretation., \"(Texas Republicans) believe in abolishing Social Security, abolishing V.A. health care.\" There have been no shortage of claims about Obamacare in the build up to the health insurance marketplaces opening on Oct. 1.\n",
              "On MSNBC, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., called the effort by some Republicans to defund Obamacare in exchange for funding the government \"nickels and dimes\" in comparison with other stances they take.\n",
              "\"What Mr. (Ted) Cruz and his Republican friends think in terms of health care is that we should voucherize Medicare, make massive cuts in Medicaid and ignore the fact 48 million Americans have no health insurance at all,\" he said Sept. 25.\n",
              "He used the Republican Party of Texas to criticize the beliefs of the entire party.\n",
              "\"If you look at something like the Texas Republican platform, do you know what they believe in? They believe not only in getting rid of Obamacare,\" he said. \"They believe in abolishing Social Security, abolishing V.A. (Veterans Affairs) health care.\"\n",
              "It’s not shocking that most Republicans would have differing views on these programs than Sanders, who caucuses with the Democrats. But do they really call for these services to be abolished? We wanted to find out.\n",
              "Sanders was referring to the Republican Party of Texas 2012 party platform , spokesman Michael Briggs told PolitiFact in an email. We noticed the platform’s language called for the \"privatization\" of both government programs, but never mentioned the word \"abolish\" or anything similar.\n",
              "GOP Texas Chairman Steve Munisteri said the group does not support abolishment. \"To me, both statements he made are grossly inaccurate,\" he said.\n",

              "Proposed Social Security changes\n",
              "Munisteri emphasized that the proposed Social Security changes would not affect retirees and near-retirees, who have already paid into the Social Security system.\n",
              "Then, for younger people, the platform calls for a \"transition to a system of private pensions based on the concept of individual retirement accounts.\"\n",
              "According to previous proposed privatization plans, this would entail individuals redirecting all or part of their current Social Security taxes to a personal account, which would be invested in some sort of asset, said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute who specializes in Social Security policy.\n",
              "\"They’re very different programs, but there still exists a mandatory, government-regulated retirement program,\" he said. \"People would not be free to invest in their brother-in-law’s South American gold mining stock.\"\n",
              "Former President George W. Bush and others have proposed many Social Security privatization plans over the years, but we should note that the platform Sanders referenced doesn’t cite any specific proposal. Still, privatizing Social Security isn’t the same thing as abolishing it.\n",
              "Efficient care for veterans\n",
              "The Republican Party of Texas platform directly addresses health care for veterans, saying, \"The Veterans Administration must become more responsive and more efficient by eliminating its backlog and reducing waiting times for treatment. We support the privatization of veterans' heath care.\"\n",
              "To Munisteri, the platform’s call for the privatization of health care means exploring a system in which the government would pay veterans to seek out private health care. Currently, veterans enrolled in the program seek treatment from government-funded facilities.\n",
              "\"The current system is causing veterans to wait too long (for treatment),\" he said. \"We support having other options available for veterans.\"\n",
              "Kevin Bacon, a public affairs professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said abolishment of a health care system -- one that includes more than 8.7 million veterans, 150 hospitals and 80 clinics -- would not be a realistic stance. Veterans face a unique set of medical issues that need to be treated, like multiple amputations and PTSD, he said.\n",
              "\"Privatization is one of those terms that have so many different flavors to it,\" Bacon said, noting the complexity of the issue.\n",
              "There are lots of different propositions out there to privatize health care, but no serious options call for an end to providing health care for veterans, Bacon said.\n",
              "Due to a host of different possibilities within the realm of privatized veterans’ care and again, a broad statement from the GOP platform, it’s unclear to us if the V.A. facilities would remain open if the system were privatized.\n",
              "In any case, the Oxford dictionary defines \"abolish\" as meaning to \"formally put an end to (a system, practice, or institution).\" While the privatization of either system Sanders mentioned could drastically change the way these issues are handled, the government would not be removing itself from the responsibility of providing either of these services. Generally speaking, government-funded medical treatment for veterans and retirement benefits for seniors would still exist in some form., \"(The Opportunity Scholarship Act) would be funded directly from public school budgets. So it would absolutely take money out of the public school system to transfer to private and religious schools.\" Thousands of students could receive a private education through corporate donations to a so-called \"scholarship\" program, but one critic claims the proposed school voucher program would be funded on the backs of public schools.\n",
              "Julia Sass Rubin, a spokeswoman for the anti-voucher group Save Our Schools NJ, explained the funding mechanism within the proposed legislation, known as the Opportunity Scholarship Act, during a recent interview on News 12 New Jersey’s Power & Politics show.\n",
              "\"(The Opportunity Scholarship Act) would be funded directly from public school budgets,\" Rubin said during the show broadcast on Dec. 3 and 4. \"So it would absolutely take money out of the public school system to transfer to private and religious schools.\"\n",
              "After reviewing the legislation, PolitiFact New Jersey determined that Rubin skipped a few elements of the proposed voucher program, but she still has a point that public schools would lose state aid as a result.\n",
              "There’s no direct link between the scholarships and public school budgets, as Rubin said. Students would receive scholarships through donations made by corporations, and use them to pay for tuition at other public schools or private schools.\n",
              "However, those corporations would get tax credits in return, and to make up for that lost tax revenue, the state would withhold aid from the students’ original school districts.\n",
              "In a phone interview, Rubin acknowledged the process involving the tax credits, but argued that public schools are ultimately paying for the program.\n",
              "\"It’s like a money laundering scheme,\" Rubin told us. \"It’s a direct reduction in school aid. So the schools are paying for it.\"\n",
              "Let’s explain how the proposed voucher program would work:\n",
              "The Opportunity Scholarship Act is part of Gov. Chris Christie’s education reform agenda, but the legislation has stalled in the Legislature since early this year. About two weeks ago, opponents and supporters of the bill held competing rallies, one in Jersey City and one in Trenton.\n",
              "The current version of the Act would set up a five-year pilot program to award scholarships to public and private school students residing in 13 school districts with failing schools, including Asbury Park and Newark. Public school students would be able to leave those districts and attend school elsewhere.\n",
              "Three organizations throughout the state would distribute the scholarships to parents or guardians of the selected students.\n",
              "Corporations making donations for the scholarships would get tax credits worth 100 percent of the value of their donations, costing the state millions’ worth of tax revenue. That’s where the school aid dollars come in.\n",
              "According to the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, which analyzed the Senate version of the bill, up to nearly $1.2 billion in state aid would be initially withheld from the 13 districts over the course of the program. Of that amount, about $354 million would be returned to the districts, according to OLS.\n",
              "But the remaining roughly $840 million would be retained by the state to offset the loss of corporate business taxes, according to OLS.\n",
              "So, the scholarships would not be directly funded by public school dollars, but in a roundabout way, education aid would be withheld to cover the tax credits granted to donors providing the scholarships.\n",
              "But Adam Bauer, a spokesman for Republican state Sen. Tom Kean Jr., one of the bill’s sponsors, argued that under the state’s school funding formula, schools would lose a proportionate share of state aid if their enrollment declined for any other reason.\n",
              "\"That’s how the formula works,\" Bauer said in an email. \"Why then is it such a travesty when this happens as a result of a student choosing to go elsewhere as part of a scholarship program?\", \"(The Tax Policy Center) found that Romney would raise taxes on the average middle class family by $2,000 to pay for $5 trillion in tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires.\" Millionaires and billionaires could see trillions in tax cuts paid for by the middle class if Mitt Romney gets his way, New Jersey Democrats claim.\n",
              "Just as President Barack Obama has done in a recent campaign ad , the New Jersey Democratic State Committee has latched onto a new study from the Washington, D.C.-based Tax Policy Center. The study says that under the presumptive Republican presidential candidate’s proposals, wealthy taxpayers pay fewer taxes and middle- and lower-income taxpayers pay more.\n",
              "\"The non-partisan organization found that Romney would raise taxes on the average middle class family by $2,000 to pay for $5 trillion in tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires,\" the committee said in an Aug. 1 news release.\n",
              "The Democrats are right about the $2,000 tax hike on the average middle-class family, but they’re wrong in citing \"$5 trillion in tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires.\" Those wealthy taxpayers would get a tax break, but not that much.\n",
              "First, let’s explain the purpose behind the study.\n",
              "Romney has proposed various tax cuts, including a 20 percent reduction in all federal income tax rates. But Romney’s plan also allows certain tax benefits for low-income households to expire.\n",
              "Those changes would mean lower taxes at most income levels -- but that’s before the candidate’s plan is paid for. The Romney campaign has not specified how the plan would offset that tax revenue loss, but the Tax Policy Center study gives it a shot.\n",
              "In short, those tax cuts would require eliminating or reducing certain tax deductions and write-offs, according to the study. Those items include mortgage interest deductions and education-related tax credits.\n",
              "Still, for wealthy taxpayers, the cost of losing those tax loopholes is less than the money gained from the tax cuts. That’s why they’re left with a net tax break.\n",
              "But for middle- and lower-income folks, it’s the other way around. They stand to lose more in tax loopholes than gain by the tax cuts, leaving them with a greater tax bill at the end of the day.\n",
              "So, the Democrats’ claim accurately makes that overall point, but wrongly compares the $2,000 and $5 trillion figures. Think of it as an apples-to-oranges comparison.\n",
              "After factoring in eliminating or reducing the tax loopholes, the average tax hike in 2015 would be about $2,000 for taxpayers making less than $200,000 a year, who also have children.\n",
              "But the $5 trillion represents the potential tax cuts over a 10-year period before you account for eliminating or reducing those loopholes. Higher-income taxpayers would end up with a net tax break, but the total savings would be far less than $5 trillion.\n",
              "Here’s the number Democrats should have cited: taxpayers with incomes exceeding $1 million, on average, would get a roughly $87,000 net tax break in 2015. Take away those tax loopholes, and wealthy taxpayers would still get that amount.\n",
              "It’s also worth noting that Democrats are wrong to suggest only \"millionaires and billionaires\" would benefit from Romney’s plan.\n",
              "Those wealthy taxpayers would receive the greatest net tax savings, but other average taxpayers making more than $200,000 would benefit as well. For instance, taxpayers earning between $200,000 and $500,000, on average, would receive a net tax break of roughly $1,800., \"(The farm bill) has a provision that would in many ways reduce the deficit.\" Political pundits had plenty of controversies to dish about during the final Sunday news shows of 2013.

For bills like the farm bill, CBO analysts use accepted economic forecasting methods to essentially make their best guess about how programs will affect the budget under existing law.\n",
              "The office projected the costs of each chamber’s farm bills since spring 2013, with new estimates coming later to account for amendments and other money-related changes tacked on during the lawmaking process. To give a big picture, the analysts make some assumptions about future policy. Their estimates for the farm bills, for example, assume that programs set to expire would be reauthorized without major changes in 2018 through 2023.\n",
              "Let’s start with CBO’s \"baseline.\" The office assumed that if the programs in the farm bill continued in their current form over the next decade, it would cost $973 billion.\n",
              "In its May analysis , CBO found the Senate bill would reduce that total by $17.9 billion through 2023. In other words, it would have net-deficit reduction of almost $18 billion. The pair of House bills would go further, CBO found , reducing the deficit by a total of $51.9 billion. The House would cut about 10 times more in the food stamps program than the Senate ($4 billion versus $40 billion).\n",
              "We’re still waiting on final cost estimates from CBO because we’re still waiting on a final conference bill agreed to by representatives of both parties.\n",
              "Both bills rack up savings by cutting back on crop subsidy and conservation programs, including eliminating direct payments to farmers regardless of whether they are currently farming their land. That program costs about $5 billion a year and was conceived in 1996 as a temporary solution. The bill would spend some of the savings achieved from cutting those payments by investing into its crop insurance program and  allowing more farmers to get subsidies.\n",
              "As evidence for her claim, Brazile sent us her email correspondence with a Senate aide, who said the details are not firm, but the final version of the bill negotiated by representatives of the House and Senate will include about $20 billion in spending cuts from 2014-23.\n",
              "CBO projections for that bill are not yet available.\n",
              "Critics of the farm bill, like Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense, find it silly when people brag about \"paltry\" cost savings that comes with legislation authorizing mammoth spending. The bill would save even more if it had just eliminated direct payments without expanding farm entitlement programs, Ellis said, such as one that would guarantee farmers 90 percent of their revenue in the event of a disaster.\n",
              "\"Technically, they’re right, there is the CBO score,\" Ellis said. \"It’s only in Washington where you can talk about spending $1 trillion and talk about how it’s saving you money.\"\n",
              "Ellis pointed out that most of the savings anticipated by CBO come in 2018-23, which is after the farm bill being worked on now would expire. So about 70 percent of the anticipated savings in the Senate version, for instance, are based on the assumption that policy changes would continue in a future farm bill.\n",
              "His group has criticized CBO’s estimates for the costs of recent farm bills as much too rosy, with the final 10-year cost of recent farm bills coming in billions more than CBO projected.\n",
              "CBO addressed discrepancies like it in a Q&A .The office builds forecasts on current law, but lawmakers often change laws in ways that could significantly drive up the actual cost of legislation from what was projected, CBO says. Other times, legislation changes after CBO produced its projection.\n",
              "\"The differences between outcomes and projections can be misleading measures of the quality of the projections unless adjustments are made for changes in laws,\" the CBO said.\n",
              "Ferd Hoefner, National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition policy director, said it’s very hard to pin down the exact effect of the farm bill on the deficit because it depends in large part on the future prices of commodities.\n",
              "\"How can you guess what the price is going to be in 2020?\" he said. \"Will (the cuts) be as great as what the Congressional Budget Office predicts? Perhaps, but it’s hard to tell.\", \"(U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston) voted to fund (Obamacare).\" U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston, a Republican from Savannah, was recently on the Fox News Channel to talk about his approach to make \"Obamacare\" work better for Americans.\n",
              "Fellow Georgia congressman Paul Broun, apparently, wasn’t impressed.\n",
              "\"Jack Kingston wants to keep Obamacare,\" Broun said in a YouTube video. \"He voted to fund it and now he wants to fix it.\"\n",
              "Broun, an Athens Republican, ended the two-minute video by explaining his approach to improving health care -- and it starts with repealing the controversial health care law.\n",
              "The two Republicans are in a crowded field of candidates vying to win the GOP’s U.S. Senate nomination in 2014 for the Georgia seat being left open by Sen. Saxby Chambliss’ retirement.\n",
              "Kingston disputed Broun’s claim, which prompted Broun’s campaign to dispatch a press release titled: \"Broun to Kingston: How Is This a Lie?\"\n",
              "PolitiFact Georgia thought we’d get in the middle of this dispute.\n",
              "Broun spokeswoman Christine Hardman offered two examples of what he said were Kingston’s votes for the law. The first was Kingston’s vote in September 2012 for an appropriations bill. The second was Kingston’s support for a budget written earlier this year by former GOP vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan, a House member from Wisconsin.\n",
              "The 2012 legislation, House Joint Resolution 117, was a bill that helped fund the federal government for six months, through March 2013. The legislation provided $1 trillion for federal agencies, services and disaster recovery. The federal agencies include the U.S. Health and Human Services Department, which oversees the health care law.\n",
              "\"The bill makes minimal changes to fiscal year 2012 spending levels, except in cases that would cause catastrophic, irreversible, or detrimental changes to government programs, and to ensure good government and program oversight,\" the Republican-led House Appropriations Committee said in a statement at the time.\n",
              "The resolution passed by a 329-91 margin, with nine House members who didn’t vote. Broun was one of the 91 no votes, along with Rep. Phil Gingrey, a House Republican who is also running for the U.S. Senate. Kingston voted in favor of the bill, as did all 10 of his remaining colleagues from Georgia.\n",
              "Now, to the other half of Broun’s case against Kingston.\n",
              "On March 12, Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman, presented his latest plan to balance the federal budget in 10 years. Much of it calls for spending cuts and projected revenue increases through tax cuts to businesses that Ryan believes will help the economy grow. Six days later, Broun wrote an op-ed that appeared in The New York Times decrying Ryan’s plan, saying the cuts don’t go far enough.\n",
              "\"We must repeal Obamacare — including the associated taxes, which the Ryan budget leaves intact by assuming the enactment of tax reform later on. We’ll replace it with a market-based health care system devoid of government involvement and managed by patients and their doctors, a plan I have described in my Patient Option Act,\" Broun, who practiced general medicine, wrote.\n",
              "Congress, as you know, has not been able to agree on a long-term budget plan. A resolution sponsored by Ryan to fund the government on a short-term basis passed the House on March 21. Kingston voted in favor of the resolution, but Broun cast his vote against it.\n",
              "Kingston spokesman Chris Crawford said the rationale behind Broun’s claim is illogical.\n",
              "\"The whole premise that Mr. Kingston supports Obamacare or has wavered in his dedication to its repeal is absurd,\" Crawford told us via email. \"He has voted more than 40 times to repeal and replace. That effort has seen seven parts of the law dismantled or defunded.\"\n",
              "Kingston’s congressional website is full of news releases critical of the law or highlighting his votes against it. He voted against the bill when it passed the House by a slim majority in March 2010.\n",
              "Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan watchdog group, said Broun was \"nibbling around the edges\" with his claim because Kingston voted against the original legislation. She noted the September 2012 appropriations bill helped fund spending to operate the federal government, and it was not an entitlement bill.\n",
              "\"That accusation doesn’t reflect anything close to someone supporting Obamacare,\" said MacGuineas.\n",
              "So where does this leave us?\n",
              "Again, Broun said Kingston has voted to fund the health care law. Kingston has voted for federal legislation to keep the government running. Broun is using that to base his argument since the legislation includes spending for the health care law. However, it was a piece of a much larger spending package that includes defense spending and disaster recovery. Using that logic, Kingston could argue that Broun voted against defense spending.\n",
              "Broun’s claim contains an element of accuracy, but it gives people a misleading perception of Kingston’s position on Obamacare., \"(U.S. Reps.) Paul Ryan, Sean Duffy and Reid Ribble are … shutting down town hall meetings, or making their constituents pay to attend them.\" For members of Congress, the \"town hall\" meeting with constituents has taken on a new dynamic. The once-routine chats with the folks back home have, at times, become highly charged sessions with large crowds. They’ve become a barometer of sorts of public sentiment -- or the ability of opponents to organize.\n",
              "Democrats faced hostile crowds during the summer of 2009 when the hot topic was the federal health care reform bill. Some of the meetings drew hundreds and saw shouting, pushing and shoving. President Barack Obama decried what he called \"scare tactics\" from opponents. And one left leaning blog ran a list of dozens of town hall meetings believed to be targeted for disruption.\n",
              "Congressional Republicans got a similar reception in the spring and summer of 2011.\n",
              "The frequent topic: Proposals by House Budget Committee Chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to alter Medicare. Tempers flared and meetings were disrupted, including one in April in Racine where Ryan asked police to remove a protester.\n",
              "So as Congress settled into its August break, the Wisconsin Democratic Party took a shot at some of the state’s GOP members of Congress -- Ryan, and freshmen Sean Duffy and Reid Ribble.\n",
              "In an Aug. 17, 2011 email to supporters, state Democratic Party chairman Mike Tate said: \"Paul Ryan, Sean Duffy and Reid Ribble are so ashamed to own up to their disastrous records that they are shutting down town hall meetings, or making their constituents pay to attend them.\"\n",
              "Buried amid the heated, and opinionated, rhetoric -- \"so ashamed to own up to their disastrous records\" -- there’s a powerful factual claim: Are the three \"shutting down\" town hall meetings or \"making constituents pay\" to see them?\n",
              "A Democratic Party spokesman did not respond to an email request for evidence backing up the statement. So we were left to search the public record and to make our own calls.\n",
              "The genesis of the claim appears to be a Politico article from the day before the party’s release that began this way: \"The House Budget Committee chairman isn’t holding any face-to-face open-to-the-public town hall meetings during the recess, but like several of his colleagues he will speak only for residents willing to open their wallets.\"\n",
              "Now, what about the party’s claim?\n",
              "The claim starts off on a wrong track: Ribble participated in a forum in Appleton on Aug. 8, 2011, and Duffy held a town hall meeting in Wausau on Aug. 15, 2011. Ryan, meanwhile, held an Aug. 8, 2011 \"telephone town hall meeting\" with residents of Rock County.\n",
              "So, all three had meetings of some variety -- in person or the newfangled phone-in approach -- before the party’s claim was even made.\n",
              "Indeed, members of Congress don’t always have town hall meetings during a recess. And by at least one measure, Republicans were more likely to do so this time than Democrats.\n",
              "A nonpartisan group called No Labels released a survey Aug. 22, 2011 that found \"67.9% of Democrats and 50.8% of Republicans stating they had no town hall meetings scheduled for the recess period.\"\n",
              "So what about the second thrust of the Democratic claim: Are the Republicans hiding behind a pay wall?\n",
              "We found three events where money was involved. The events were not fund-raisers for the congressmen, but lunch meetings open to the public that carried a cost.\n",
              "The most highly publicized -- and politicized -- one is an appearance by Ryan on Sept. 6, 2011 sponsored by the Whitnall Park Rotary Club.\n",
              "The club’s website says: \"This is NOT a town hall meeting format, and the $15 fee covers only the lunch and other costs incurred in enabling an open public invitation.\"\n",
              "Club officer Gilbert Freen told us the group routinely charges guests to cover the cost of the lunch served at its meetings.\n",
              "The Democrats, some union groups and others view this as outrageous. Citizen Action of Wisconsin says it is organizing buses to bring people to protest Ryan’s appearance.\n",
              "But politicians of all stripes regularly appear at such luncheons.\n",
              "For instance, on Aug. 23, 2011, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis) spoke to the Rotary Club of Milwaukee. That event was not open to the public -- just to members and their guests, who paid $17.50 each. Numerous other politicians (including Ryan and Moore together in 2009) have appeared at Newsmaker Luncheons sponsored by the Milwaukee Press Club. At those events, which are open to the public, a fee is charged -- for the lunch.\n",
              "Ryan’s office said the Whitnall club meeting was the only event the congressman had scheduled during the August break that involved a charge.\n",
              "We found two other paid events, one each from Ribble and Duffy.\n",
              "Ribble’s office said he participated in the Aug. 8 forum addressing regulation with two other local civic groups. \"I believe it was at lunchtime and there was a cost for the lunch,\" said Ribble spokeswoman Ashley Olson.\n",
              "Duffy participated in one event -- an Aug. 18, 2011 small business forum at the University of Wisconsin-Superior -- where participants were charged $15 for lunch and materials.\n",
              "So, each of the three GOP congressmen singled out had at least one event where a fee was charged. But such appearances are routine tor politicians of both parties, the fee covered lunch and did not go to the congressman.\n",
              "The thrust of the statement, though, was broader still -- that the three were \"shutting down\" town hall meetings and thus the ability to talk to the elected official.\n",
              "Here’s what we found about the summer recess schedule for each when we asked aides, checked public schedules and looked at news accounts:\n",
              "Ryan:  Toured various local businesses, held \"multiple hour-long meetings\" with small business owners, Realtors and home builders. In addition to the \"telephone town hall meeting,\" attended the Walworth County Fair, a Boy Scout lunch and a 75th anniversary lunch for Kenosha Beef. Constituents could contact Ryan’s office for an appointment to meet with him in his office, said spokesman Conor Sweeney. Ryan was on vacation in Colorado for part of the month.\n",
              "Ribble: Held a three-hour \"Conversations with your Congressman\" on Aug. 13, 2011 -- 10 minute one-on-one meetings; attended an Aug. 12, 2011 forum on transportation; an Alzheimers Association public input session, and a forum with seniors about Medicare.\n",
              "Duffy: Like many House members with large districts, Duffy maintains a mobile office, and its schedule is listed prominently on the congressman’s web page. Duffy himself is on the bus some, but not all, of the time, said Brandon Moody, chief of staff. Moody said Duffy has spent the entire August break in his northern Wisconsin district. Including the town meeting in Wausau, he held a half dozen coffees and, yes, community town hall meetings. He also visited county fairs and toured area businesses.\n",
              "No fee was charged for any of these events, or for access to the congressman.\n",
              "Our conclusion:\n",
              "The state Democrats say that three Republican congressmen from Wisconsin are shutting down town hall meetings or making constituents pay to attend them. Yet all three had town hall meetings or participated in a forum -- in person, or by phone -- before the statement was made. And one, Duffy, participated in several town hall meetings.\n",
              "In fact, one review showed many members of Congress did not have any town hall meetings -- and Democrats were less likely than Republicans to hold them. What’s more, the party provided no evidence Ryan or the others were not available to constituents during the break.\n",
              "Finally, the assertion that appearing at a Rotary lunch that is open to the public is \"charging constituents\" for access is far off the mark.\n",
              "The party’s claim is not only false, but ridiculously so. It’s Pants on Fire., \"... study after study has shown that the death penalty deters murders.\" The deterrent effect of execution on murders has long been debated, but Thompson suggests the matter has been resolved. Not so. Here is the full assertion from Thompson's broadcast on ABC radio June 27:\n",
              "\"...study after study has shown that the death penalty deters murders. Some studies show really dramatic effects, with each execution of a murderer deterring as many as 18 or more murders. That's according to Emory University professors, who found as well that delaying execution also leads to further murders. Most studies have concluded that some number of murders between three and 18 are prevented for every application of capital punishment.\"\n",
              "A dozen research papers in the last six years support Thompson's assertion that capital punishment prevents murders, according to the Associated Press. Three studies get the most attention: a 2006 report by two economists and statistical papers in 2003 and 2006 from the Emory researchers.\n",
              "The Law & Order star accurately quotes the Emory study, but his generalizations about \"most studies\" ignore significant contrary research.\n",
              "A handful of studies directly challenge pro-deterrence findings by highlighting various missteps in methodology. \"These studies fail to reach the demanding standards of social science to make such strong claims, standards such as replication and basic comparisons with other scenarios,\" said Jeffery Fagan of the Columbia Law School during testimony before a New York legislative panel.\n",
              "Most notable is a paper by two National Bureau of Economic Research fellows who concluded \"that execution policy drives little of the year-to-year variation in homicide rates. As to whether executions rise or lower the homicide rate, we remain profoundly uncertain.\", \"...Over 30 years, federal spending on education has grown by 375 percent, but test scores remain flat.\" U.S. Rep. Dave Brat wants to rein in federal funding for public education.\n",
              "Brat, R-7th, backs the Student Success Act, a GOP bill that would scale back Uncle Sam’s role in overseeing public schools and consolidate dozens of federal education programs.\n",
              "On Feb. 11, he introduced a successful amendment in the House Education and Workforce Committee that would require the U.S. Department of Education to issue annual reports recommending ways to save on school spending. Brat, a former college professor, expressed his thoughts in classical terms:\n",
              "\"The greatest thinkers of Western Civ. were not products of education policy,\" he said. \"Socrates trained Plato on a rock and then Plato trained Aristotle, roughly speaking, on a rock. So huge education funding is not necessary to achieve the greatest minds and the greatest intellects in history.\"\n",
              "Five days later, Brat took to Facebook and posted his view in modern terms. \"Our own government statistics show that over 30 years, federal spending on education has grown by 375%, but test scores have remained flat,\" he wrote. \"That proves that just throwing more money at education is not the solution.\"\n",
              "We wondered whether Brat’s Facebook post is accurate, both in terms of the 30-year growth percentage for federal education funding and his characterization of test scores as \"flat.\"\n",
              "Brian Gottstein, a spokesman for Bratt, said the congressman’s statement was based on July 2012 testimony by Neal McCluskey before a U.S. Senate education subcommittee. McCluskey, is director of the Center for Educational Freedom at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. He said that federal education cuts mandated under sequestration -- Congress’s 2011 agreement to chop domestic and defense spending in return for raising the nation’s borrowing limit -- \"are both necessary and overdue.\" McCluskey argued that increasing school funding has not improved student performance.\n",
              "Let’s take a closer look.\n",
              "Funding levels\n",
              "A reading of McCluskey’s testimony instantly turns up an inaccuracy in Brat’s statement.  McCluskey said the 375 percent increase, adjusted for inflation, occurred over a 40-year period from 1970 to 2010. Brat posted that the increase occurred over 30 years and didn’t offer dates.\n",
              "McCluskey cited White House figures showing federal outlays for elementary, secondary and vocational education were $2.9 billion in 1970 and rose to $73.3 billion in 2010. When adjusted for inflation, that comes to about a 375 percent increase.\n",
              "But there’s an issue with using 2010 as the end date for measuring the growth. U.S. education spending hit a record high in 2010, bolstered by more than $30 billion in special stimulus money Washington sent states in the wake of the Great Recession to help pay for schools.\n",
              "The stimulus program has stopped and during the last budget year -- ending Sept. 30, 2014 -- the U.S. spent $40.8 billion on education. Going back 30 years, as Brat did, puts us in 1984 when federal spending on schools was $6.5 billion. Adjusted for inflation, that’s a 176 percent increase -- less than half of the congressman’s figure.\n",
              "Now, let’s throw in another factor: the number of students in publicly-funded schools across the nation increased from 39.2 million in 1984 to a projected 50 million in 2014. Federal spending per student rose from $165 in 1984 to about $816 in 2014. Adjusted for inflation, that’s a 117 percent increase -- less than one-third of Brat’s figure.\n",
              "We should note that when we queried Brat’s office about the Feb. 16 Facebook post, spokesman Gottstein sent us a Feb. 11 news release in which the congressmen correctly said that the 375 increase in education spending took place over 40 years -- from 1970 to 2010.  The public, however, doesn’t have access to this detail. Brat’s congressional website doesn’t contain a copy of the release, but it does link to his Facebook post, which says \"over 30 years, federal spending on education has grown by 375 percent...\"\n",
              "We just used an ellipsis. So let’s look at the second part of Brat’s statement.\n",
              "Test scores\n",
              "Brat’s claim that test scores \"have been flat\" again comes from McCluskey’s 2012 Senate testimony. McCluskey said that between 1970 and 2010, math and reading scores on National Assessment of Educational Progress tests, \"have been almost stagnant for 17-year-olds, the final product of our elementary and secondary system.\"\n",
              "The NAEP, frequently called \"The Nation’s Report Card,\" refers to a variety of tests given every four years to fourth, eighth and twelfth graders in a sampling of states. McCluskey focused on the \"long-term trend\" test for 17-year-olds, which since the early 1970s has measured achievement on an unchanged set of math and reading skills.\n",
              "On the first NAEP reading test, in 1971, 17-year-olds had an average score of 285 on a scale of 500. On the most recent test, in 2012, the average was 287.\n",
              "On the first math test, in 1973, the average was 304 and that inched to 306 in 2012.\n",
              "The scores don’t change much if you measure them over the 30 years Brat mentions on Facebook. The average math score in 1982 was 298 and rose by eight points over the next three decades. The average reading score in 1984 -- the reading test wasn’t given in 1982 -- was 289 and fell by two points in 2012.\n",
              "Brat is hardly the first to call the results for 17-year-olds \"flat.\" Education Week, a nationally-circulated periodical, used the same term in a 2009 headline to describe the history of NAEP scores for the age group. The chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee that year -- Rep. George Miller, D-Calif. -- called it \"deeply troubling\" that high schoolers were not making \"meaningful gains\" on the tests. U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan said in 2014 that NAEP results underscore a need to \"reject educational stagnation in our high schools.\"\n",
              "Many educators say the focus on average test results for all 17-year-olds overlooks significant gains by other groups and subgroups taking the NAEP. For example, from 1982-2012:\n",
              "Average math scores of 17-year-old blacks rose 16 points\n",
              "Average math scores of 17-year-old Hispanics rose 17 points\n",
              "Average math scores of all nine-year-olds rose 25 points\n",
              "Average math scores for all 13-year-olds rose 16 points., \"...Secret documents reveal that Iran could obtain a nuclear weapon far sooner than we were told.

Independent expenditure PACs can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money in support of or in opposition to political candidates, but are prohibited from coordinating their activities with or donating directly to candidate campaigns. This means that Kirk would not have known about the IVFI ad before it appeared.\n",
              "There’s not much information out there on the group. But we did find the PAC’s treasurer Jo Merlau submitted its statement of organization in February 2015, according to the Federal Election Commission.\n",
              "The political research website Open Secrets shows IVFI has raised more than $1.6 million in 2016 with hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations coming from people like Chicago businessman Ken Griffin and New York hedge fund manager Paul Singer. Open Secrets also showed IVFI spent money on vendors supporting failed Republican presidential candidates John Kasich , Marco Rubio and Bobby Jindal .\n",
              "Notably, IVFI filed three independent expenditures in late July and early August with the FEC for media production. The payments went to the Washington, D.C., media firm Strategic Media Services, Inc., and the documents showed a media placement/media production order opposing Duckworth. Strategic Media Services did not return calls to confirm whether they were responsible for the ad.\n",
              "The Iran deal, the IVFI advertisement and the Associated Press\n",
              "Next, let’s look at the Iran nuclear deal. In the original document outlining the deal, the JCPOA never says it would allow Iran to build or obtain a nuclear weapon before the 15-year deal expires. In fact, the JCPOA says, \"Iran reaffirms that under no circumstances will Iran ever seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons,\" and reiterates that point throughout the deal.\n",
              "The IVFI PAC video ad says secret documents that were leaked contain information about the Iran deal. An illustration in the video indicates they are referencing information reported in a July 18 article by the Associated Press. The Associated Press reported an unnamed source leaked unpublished information about an add-on agreement to the JCPOA. The source told the Associated Press members of Congress knew about the add-on agreement, but its contents never were made public.\n",
              "However, the Associated Press only references one confidential document in its story. The Associated Press, in fact, says this \"confidential document is the only text linked to last year’s deal between Iran and six foreign powers that hasn’t been made public.\"\n",
              "IVFI’s ad incorrectly says there are multiple secret documents. That implied the federal government was hiding more information than was actually reported in the Associated Press story.\n",
              "Investigating the specific language of the IVFI ad reveals another discrepancy with the Associated Press story. The IVFI ad says \"Iran could obtain a nuclear weapon far sooner than we were told,\" according to \"secret documents.\"\n",
              "However, the Associated Press story never says that. The story says the leaked document revealed that Iran’s nuclear limitations will ease up earlier than what is outlined in the 15-year deal approved in January. It also says the internally negotiated deal would advance \"Tehran's ability to build a bomb even before the end of the pact.\" Even though Iran will have the ability, it would not be allowed to create a fully completed weapon until the deal ends.\n",
              "The Associated Press goes further, saying the contents of the secret document give Iran fewer limits on installing more advanced centrifuges to churn uranium for the core of a nuclear weapon. However, the Associated Press explicitly says Iran’s ability to install these newer centrifuges doesn’t mean it would be allowed to build bombs before the 15-year pact ends. From the Associated Press story:\n",
              "(The centrifuge machines) will give Iran a huge potential boost in enrichment capacity, including bomb making should it choose to do so. But it can be put to use only after the deal expires.\n",
              "The story never reports Iran can obtain a nuclear weapon sooner than outlined in the JCPOA, as claimed in the IVFI advertisement.\n",
              "The secret document and the JCPOA\n",
              "The Associated Press story reveals the contents of a secret document showing an add-on agreement imposing fewer restrictions to the JCPOA.\n",
              "But Daniel Joyner, the director of international programs at the University of Alabama School of Law, says not so fast.\n",
              "\"The (Associated Press) story isn’t wrong. It’s just a little misleading,\" he said.\n",
              "Joyner points out the contents of the leaked secret document aren’t much different from pages 6 and 7 of the JCPOA, which deals with centrifuge and uranium enrichment regulation.\n",
              "\"You’ll see there that the commitments with regard to centrifuges last for 10 years, not for 15. So the confidential document, which discusses years 11-13, does not contradict the terms of the JCPOA.\n",
              "So why would anyone interpret this new information as something that conflicts with the JCPOA?\n",
              "\"There are people out there who are out to kill (the JCPOA),\" Joyner said. \"The fact that it was from a confidential source throws up some red flags. There’s nothing contradictory in the leaked documents.\", \"...some of those (tax increases) were either court-ordered, or they were voted on by the people and approved by the people for (such) things as roads.\" Mike Huckabee has been telling the same story for a year. Attacked early on for raising taxes more than he cut them, Huckabee began laying the tax increases off on others. There was, for example, that matter of the 3-cent increase in the gas tax in Arkansas in 1999 accompanied by a 4-cent increase in the diesel tax, which is paid mostly by truckers.\n",
              "\"You know what we did?\" he said to George Stephanopoulos of ABC News last Feb. 11, 2007. \"We put it on the ballot, and 80 percent of the people of Arkansas voted for the fuel taxes because they wanted better roads.\"\n",
              "The voters voted all right – but not on the taxes. Instead, voters approved (by 80 percent) a $575-million bond issue that would be supported by the diesel tax and future federal highway funds. The diesel tax and the gasoline tax were going to take effect regardless of how the public voted.\n",
              "The Arkansas legislature had approved those taxes on April 1, 1999, and the first penny of the gas tax and the first 2 cents of diesel tax were already in effect on June 15, when voters went to the polls that year. (The gas tax rose by a penny each of the next two years, the diesel tax by 2 cents the next year.)\n",
              "The taxes and the bonds were a package plan, and Huckabee was its strong advocate. The plan to sell bonds was in Act 1027, approved by the legislature the same day as the gas tax in Act 1028.\n",
              "Huckabee would be fully justified in arguing that the vote reflected support for the taxes that supported the plan to issue bonds.\n",
              "In fact, he could even argue that the voters were approving the massive additional spending on roads. If the federal grants and diesel tax weren't enough to repay the bonds, the \"full faith and credit\" of the state stood behind them. As matter of fact, the gas tax wasn't directly pledged at all.\n",
              "But you could also argue the voters had nothing to lose. Their gas tax was going up whether they approved the bonds or not. The bonds made the road-building happen much faster.\n",
              "For Huckabee and an overwhelming majority of legislators, both Democrats and Republicans, the need was clear. That year, and again in 2000, professional truck drivers surveyed by Overdrive magazine rated Interstate 40 across Arkansas, between Memphis on the eastern border and Fort Smith on the Oklahoma border, the worst highway in the country. The Arkansas portion of I-30, which runs between Dallas and Little Rock, ranked fifth worst. The Overdrive annual survey also identified Arkansas highways as the worst overall.\n",
              "The success of the plan is now also clear. By 2005, I-40 in Arkansas was the nation's \"most improved highway\" in the Overdrive survey, and I-30 was in the top five in that category.\n",
              "\"When we put that out there for the people to decide whether they wanted to affirm it, they did by an 80 percent vote,\" Huckabee said on Fox News' Hannity & Colmes on Nov. 15, 2007. \"I'd call that leadership.\"\n",
              "We'd also call that accurate – because of the phrase \"affirm it,\" which is closer to what voters actually did on the matter. So, does Huckabee's \"affirm\" language fix his claim as well as he fixed his roads? Alas, the myth of the approved tax continued.\n",
              "On Dec. 30, 2007, on NBC's Meet the Press , Huckabee responded to rival Mitt Romney's attacks on his tax record. \"He made claims about things like tax increases,\" Huckabee said, \"but he failed to mention that some of those were either court-ordered, or they were voted on by the people and approved by the people for (such) things as roads.\"\n",
              "(The \"court-ordered\" part, which refers to a $400-million increase in the sales tax for education after the Arkansas Supreme Court threw out the state's school-financing system, is also passing the buck. The court ordered a new funding system, arguably even required more spending, but didn't order any tax increase. But that's another Truth-o-Meter.)\n",
              "So how do we evaluate this \"voter approval\" claim? We can't understand politicians who have a real story to tell and then needlessly fudge some small piece of it., \"...the earth moves closer to the sun every year – you know the rotation of the earth. We’re moving closer to the sun.\" Republican Pa. Sen. Scott Wagner believes that climate change is probably happening. He also says he believes some of that change is \"manmade,\" too.\n",
              "But Wagner, a state senator from York in the midst of a run for governor, seemed this week to cite a more celestial reason why things are getting a little warmer while he was laying out policy proposals related to natural gas drilling in Pennsylvania. In a talk with natural gas advocates in Harrisburg, Wagner said climate change is probably happening, but the government should nevertheless pare down restrictive regulations on the natural gas drilling industry.\n",
              "\"I haven’t been in a science class in a long time, but the earth moves closer to the sun every year -- you know the rotation of the earth,\" Wagner said, according to State Impact, an NPR affiliate. \"We’re moving closer to the sun.\"\n",
              "He added, \"We have more people. You know, humans have warm bodies. So is heat coming off? Things are changing, but I think we are, as a society, doing the best we can.\"\n",
              "The Pennsylvania Democratic party publicly chastised Wagner for the suggestion and the senator was slammed in comments sections for the statement. So we decided to check his claim: Is the Earth really moving closer to the sun? And has body heat contributed to global climate change?\n",
              "Let’s start with the, er, \"manmade\" option first: Despite Wagner’s question, there is no evidence to suggest human body heat is causing global climate change. As PolitiFact has pointed out time and time again, the overwhelming majority of experts agree that climate change is happening and humans are causing it largely through producing carbon dioxide that exacerbates the Earth’s greenhouse effect.\n",
              "Dave Goldberg, an associate department head for undergraduate studies and a professor in Drexel University’s Department of Physics, said the idea that human body heat is changing the temperature is \"absurd.\" He said the regular energy collected from the sun is about a million times larger than the energy humans emit through body heat, so Wagner was \"off by literally a factor of a million.\"\n",
              "Wagner did say with more confidence though that the Earth \"moves closer to the sun every year,\" but that claim -- and the way he used it -- also has little root in scientific evidence.\n",
              "Donald Schneider, a distinguished professor and head of Penn State’s Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, said \"on average, we aren’t changing our distance and the Earth is not spiraling into the sun continuously.\"\n",
              "Technically, the Earth does move closer to the sun every year -- and then it moves back, in that same year. That’s because the Earth doesn’t orbit around the sun in a circular motion. Instead, Schneider explained, it maintains an elliptical orbit, so for half the year, the Earth is moving toward the sun and for the other half it’s moving away. Then the process, which Schneider said wouldn’t have an impact on climate change \"on human time scales,\" repeats every year.\n",
              "Schneider also noted that Wagner cited \"the rotation of the Earth\" when he said the Earth is moving closer to the sun, but he likely meant \"the revolution\" or the orbit of the Earth. The Earth rotates on its axis every 24 hours, not every year.\n",
              "\"The Earth moves closer to the sun every year, that can be technically true in a narrow definition,\" Schneider said. \"Half the time it is. In the context of the Earth moving closer to the sun causing the temperature to go up, I don’t think is correct.\"\n",
              "Goldberg agreed, saying he’s \"kind of disappointed in [Wagner’s] high school science teacher.\"\n",
              "\"This idea that something that happens on a one-year time scale has anything to do with what we’re seeing in terms of global warming is a ridiculous argument,\" Goldberg said, adding that it’s \"insulting\" Wagner would insinuate scientists hadn’t considered the impact of the Earth’s proximity to the sun.\n",
              "PolitiFact Pennsylvania reached out to Wagner’s office in search of evidence of his claim. His office released a statement from Wagner instead, in which he said: \"I believe that the climate is changing every day, and some of that change is certainly manmade. I think that we have a responsibility to future generations to be good stewards, and I support efforts to do that.\"\n",
              "\"However, the real question isn't is the climate changing but what role should the government play in trying to alter it,\" he said in the statement. \"I believe we have to prioritize action in a measured way so that we do not hurt our economy.\", \"1 in 100 people are sociopaths.\" A Texas congressman commenting on the man linked to bombings around Austin before blowing himself up made a claim about the prevalence of sociopaths that made us wonder.\n",
              "U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, told Karina Kling on the March 26, 2018, edition of Spectrum News’ Capital Tonight: \"He’s a sociopath. He claims I’ve been a psychopath all my life. You know, 1 in 100 people are sociopaths. They have no remorse or conscience or guilt when they commit acts of murder like in this case. So he had no remorse.\"\n",
              "A sociopath, per Merriam-Webster, is someone who behaves in a dangerous or violent way toward other people and doesn’t feel guilty about such behavior.\n",
              "And that describes 1 in 100 of us?\n",
              "A note: Our inquiries about McCaul’s claim led us to recognize that experts don’t necessarily use the word \"sociopath.\" For instance, the American Psychiatric Association responded to our inquiry about sociopaths by pointing out diagnostic criteria for \"antisocial personality disorder.\" The disorder’s essential feature is a \"pervasive pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the rights of others that begins in childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood,\" according to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The manual further says its prevalence has been found to range from 0.2 percent to 3.3 percent.\n",
              "McCaul cites FBI article\n",
              "But Lizzie Litzow of McCaul’s office told us by email that McCaul had relied on research into another disorder as described in a 2012 article in the FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin titled \"Psychopathy.\" That word, the article says, \"refers to a personality disorder that includes a cluster of interpersonal, affective, lifestyle and antisocial traits and behaviors.\" The article continues: \"These involve deception; manipulation; irresponsibility; impulsivity; stimulation seeking; poor behavioral controls; shallow affect; lack of empathy, guilt, or remorse; sexual promiscuity; callous disregard for the rights of others; and unethical and antisocial behaviors.\n",
              "\"Psychopathy,\" the article goes on, \"is the most dangerous of the personality disorders.\"\n",
              "Among indicators, the article says, is \"a profound lack of remorse for their aggressive actions, both violent and nonviolent, along with a corresponding lack of empathy for their victims. This central psychopathic concept enables them to act in a cold-blooded manner, using those around them as pawns to achieve goals and satisfy needs and desires, whether sexual, financial, physical, or emotional. Most psychopaths are grandiose, selfish sensation seekers who lack a moral compass—a conscience—and go through life taking what they want. They do not accept responsibility for their actions and find a way to shift the blame to someone or something else.\"\n",
              "To McCaul’s point, the article says it’s estimated that \"approximately 1 percent of the general male population are psychopaths, and 15 to 20 percent of the prison population are psychopathic.\"\n",
              "Psychopathy checklist\n",
              "That \"1 percent\" statement, we noticed, is footnoted to an article by psychologist Robert D. Hare , who invented and then refined a heralded diagnostic assessment of psychopathy dubbed the Hare Psychopathy Checklist. Items gauged by an expert using the checklist include a subject’s glibness/superficial charm; egocentricity; lack of remorse or guilt; parasitic lifestyle; and impulsivity. As summed up in another researcher’s 2016 article , Hare’s scale \"amalgamated many of the traits and behaviors of psychopathy using conceptual and statistical methods to provide for a more objective and dimensional assessment of psychopathy in criminal populations.\"\n",
              "We read the chapter noted by McCaul’s aide via the University of Texas library catalog and learned that Hare’s 1-in-100 statement lacked certainty. Hare wrote: \"In spite of their small numbers--perhaps 1% of the general population--they constitute a significant proportion of our prison populations and are responsible for a markedly disproportionate amount of serious crime, violence, and social distress.\"\n",
              "Next, we reached Hare, a professor emeritus at the University of British Columbia. He advised by email that many years ago he’d offered the 1 percent estimate as an informed guess -- and it held up in subsequent studies. Still, he stressed, such calculations rest in deciding what score on the checklist scale demonstrates that a person is a psychopath--and researcher judgments vary. As measured, Hare elaborated, \"psychopathy is dimensional and not a diagnostic category. So, about all we can say is that around 1% of the male population would receive a score of 30\" on the extended exam or a score of 18 on a shorter version.\n",
              "Hare also told us he doesn’t use \"sociopath\" when he’s talking about psychopaths. Sociopaths, he suggested, are capable of feeling remorse or guilt. Hare later said by phone he’s unaware of surveys gauging the prevalence of sociopaths but he’d expect the percentage to be \"fairly high.\"\n",
              "Other experts\n",
              "We also heard back from Scott Lilienfeld, an Emory University psychology professor. Lilienfeld said by email that the oft-cited 1 percent figure, rooted in research employing Hare’s checklist, \"may be defensible, although it is also oversimplified.\" He also pointed out a 2013 Emory University breakdown of misconceptions about psychopathic personalities including, it says, the idea that a person with psychopathy poses more than a modest risk of heightened violence.\n",
              "\"Evidence suggests,\" Lilienfeld told us, \"that psychopathy isn’t an either-or phenomenon; instead, it is continuously distributed, much like height and weight. So there is no scientific cut-off for distinguishing psychopaths from non-psychopaths. As a result, the 1 percent figure isn’t exactly wrong, but it’s somewhat misleading because it implies that 1 in 100 people are somewhat different in kind – rather than in degree - from the rest of us. Instead, psychopathy blends imperceptibly into normality,\" Lilienfeld said.\n",
              "Summing up, Lilienfeld called the 1-in-100 statistic informative in that it indicates \"that a nontrivial proportion of people walking among us are markedly elevated on traits such as superficial charm, social dominance, self-centeredness, dishonesty, manipulativeness, callousness, poor impulse control, and casual sexual relationships,\" he wrote.\n",
              "Also to our inquiry, John Petrila of the Dallas-based Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute pointed out a 2009 study, by researchers including Hare, that gauged the general prevalence of psychopathy. According to the study’s abstract , the researchers concluded -- after using Hare’s checklist to screen 638 individuals aged 16 to 74 in England, Wales and Scotland -- that \"psychopathy is rare, affecting less than 1% of the household population, although it is prevalent among prisoners, homeless persons and psychiatric admissions.\"\n",
              "By email, Petrila also noted a 2015 study that says in its abstract that \"psychopathy is almost exclusively investigated within criminal populations so that its prevalence in the general population has been inferred by psychopathic traits rather than disorder (1%).\" That study takes note of a 2011 study by researchers at the Queensland Institute of Technology, in Australia, that had 300 members of the general population complete a self-reported version of the psychopathy checklist and undertake a test of deception qualities. \"Results indicated that at least 1% of the current community displayed characteristics consistent with psychopathic tendencies,\" the study’s abstract says, with \"younger males who tend to misuse alcohol\" found most likely to have the tendencies., \"1 in 4 Rhode Islanders under the age of 65 does not have health insurance.\" If you live in Rhode Island and you pay any attention to politics, by now you’ve probably heard gubernatorial candidate Frank Caprio talk about his \"small business plan for Rhode Island.\" It's on his website, in his speeches, and explained in glossy fliers he passes out to voters. At political events, he encourages audiences to check out his ideas on his website.\n",
              "You don't have to ask us twice. PolitiFact has previously questioned a main component of Caprio's jobs strategy: that if every small business created one new job, unemployment would be cut in half. We found that statement Half True. Now we've spotted another claim worth checking within his small business strategy. In telling voters how he'll make health insurance more affordable for small business owners, he says  repeatedly, in campaign material and in person, that \"1 in 4 Rhode Islanders under the age of 65 does not have health insurance.\"\n",
              "(Those 65 and older are not included in the tallies because they have health insurance through the federal Medicare program.)\n",
              "The Caprio campaign said it got its numbers from two sources. The first was a report issued this spring by Mathematica Policy Research Inc. from its Washington, D.C. office. Conducted at the request of Rhode Island Health Insurance Commissioner Christopher Koller and Lieutenant Governor Elizabeth Roberts, the study was financed by the Rhode Island Foundation.\n",
              "Caprio's team noted that the analysis found that 187,000 Rhode Islanders, 21 percent -- or about 1 in 5 -- are projected to be uninsured at some point during the year. That might mean, for example, that someone loses his or her job and goes uninsured for a few months.\n",
              "The campaign said it also relied on numbers from a 2009 U.S. Senate Democratic Policy Committee report on Rhode Island. That study, issued in the heat of the health-care debate last summer, found that 27.8 percent of Rhode Islanders \"went without health insurance for some period of time,\" in 2007 and 2008. To reach that tally, it used data from Families USA, a liberal health-care advocacy organization that looks at state-by-state information.\n",
              "Caprio spokesman Nick Hemond said the campaign took both figures ––  21 percent and 27.8 percent –– and averaged them to get the 1 in 4 statistic.\n",
              "We did our own digging. For starters, we elected to steer clear of the second report Caprio talks about, the one by the Senate Democratic committee. We prefer to avoid research conducted by overtly political organizations, so as not to get caught up in partisan squabbling.\n",
              "We then consulted Koller, who was appointed by Governor Carcieri, a Republican, and confirmed by the Democrat-controlled legislature. He said that the most up-to-date report on the matter was the first report Caprio cites, the one issued this spring, by Mathematica.\n",
              "While it's true that study finds that 187,000 Rhode Islanders are likely to be uninsured at some point during the year, it also found that 140,000 people were uninsured in March, the month the report was issued.\n",
              "We think that's the more accurate number because it offers a better snapshot of how many Rhode Islanders have no insurance on an average day. And because Caprio never specified that he was referring to people who were uninsured at some point in the year, we believe voters too will interpret his statement as an average.\n",
              "The most recent Census estimate for Rhode Island's population is 1.05 million. Using those figures, Mathematica projects the number of people younger than 65 to be 889,000 in 2010. That would mean the 140,000 uninsured make up 16 percent of that population. That's 1 in 6.25 Rhode Islanders, not 1 in 4, as Caprio suggests.\n",
              "But we were curious if there was more complete data to be had, so we asked Koller.\n",
              "The Mathematica report \"is the best [data] we’ve got,\" he told us. It was calculated using Census figures on the uninsured. When examined on their own, such Census numbers can be somewhat inconsistent because of Rhode Island's small sample size. But researchers combined those numbers with the state’s unemployment figures to generate a more precise estimate. Koller said that method is common in other states.\n",
              "He stands by the report's results, reiterating that they are the most accurate he's seen in Rhode Island in quite some time.\n",
              "That's not a perfect answer, but it's the best we could find.\n",
              "Now back to Frank Caprio's statement that 1 in 4 Rhode Islanders don't have health insurance. That's a sizable difference from the Mathematica 1 in 6 finding.\n",
              "If you think we’re being too fussy, consider that the Mathematica study estimates that 140,000 Rhode Islanders have no health insurance. Use Caprio’s estimate and that number jumps to more than 220,000 people. That’s a difference of more than 80,000, about the size of the population of Cranston.\n",
              "Small percentage differences matter.\n",
              "Because Koller and other officials can’t say with absolute certainty just how many Rhode Islanders are uninsured, we’ll give Caprio a bit of leeway and call his statement Half True., \"1 out of every 4 car accidents in the U.S. is caused by texting and driving.\" Pushing safe driving on Twitter, Gov. Tony Evers urged state residents to buckle up, ditch distractions, drive sober and obey traffic laws.\n",

              "The graphic, created by Evers’ office, used a series of statistics in an attempt to drive home the point. It noted, for example, that seat belt use reduces injuries and that the blood-alcohol limit in Wisconsin is 0.08.\n",

              "A safety council report identified Wisconsin as one of a handful of states that require police to enter detailed information in each crash report showing how technology was involved. But that’s the exception rather than the rule.\n",
              "Twenty-six states don’t even have a report field to identify texting as a cause of a crash. Only three states have crash report fields addressing built-in technology in vehicles.\n",
              "A 2013 safety council study of fatal crash reports found that even when drivers admitted phone use to police, the officer listed cellphone use as a cause only half the time.\n",
              "\"There are no reliable estimates of the number of crashes caused by distracted drivers,\" the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety reports on its website. \"Statistics based on police-reported crash data almost certainly underestimate the role of distraction in fatal crashes.\"\n",
              "The stats we do have\n",
              "The insurance group said there is a clear connection between cellphone use and crash risk, based on several studies conducted over the last decade using in-vehicle cameras and sensors to monitor a sample of drivers.\n",
              "Drivers manipulating a cellphone were two to six times more likely to crash compared to when they weren’t distracted.\n",
              "But none of the available data shows a crash rate like the one Evers cited.\n",
              "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration — while noting data concerns about inconsistent reporting between police agencies — reported in April 2019 that distracted driving accounted for 9% of fatal crashes in the U.S. in 2017.\n",
              "Their analysis of crash report data showed 1.2% of fatal crashes were related to cellphone use as a distraction (401 out of 34,247).\n",
              "The last statistics the safety council compiled on texting also fall well short of Evers’ claim.\n",
              "A 2015 safety council analysis , based on 2013 data, found cellphones were a factor in 26% of all crashes, the same as the prior year.\n",
              "But texting accounted for only 6% of crashes. The other 20% were classified as \"talking.\"\n",
              "More recent data focuses on driver behaviors rather than connecting them directly to crash frequency.\n",
              "The traffic safety administration reports the number of drivers visibly manipulating a cellphone — based on an observational survey  — has risen slightly since then. But overall observed use of a handheld cellphone (not counting hands-free devices) has dropped from 4.6% in 2013 to 2.9% in 2017.\n",
              "A 2016 safety council survey found 32% of drivers were willing to occasionally review or send text messages, and 20% to 25% said they were willing to review or send email, check social media or surf the Internet.\n",
              "An Evers spokeswoman did not provide any evidence to support the texting and driving claim., \"1 percent of candidates that (the National Rifle Association) endorsed in 2012 won.\" Both supporters and critics of the National Rifle Association have acknowledged that the pro-gun group flexes significant political muscle.\n",
              "But Van Jones, one of the hosts of CNN’s Crossfire, suggested in a recent show that the NRA’s reputation of invincibility is exaggerated.\n",
              "\"The NRA is not popular on a big scale,\" Jones said. \"They can cherry-pick their focus. ... 1 percent of candidates that they endorsed in 2012 won -- 1 percent.\"\n",
              "We wondered whether the NRA was really as ineffectual in 2012 as Jones suggested. Neither Jones nor the NRA responded to inquiries for this story, but we suspect that Jones was referring to research released after the 2012 election by the Sunlight Foundation, a nonprofit group that tracks money in politics.\n",
              "The foundation looked at a variety of politically active groups to determine how much of the money they spent on the 2012 election was directed toward supporting candidates who won or opposing candidates who lost, as opposed to money spent on candidates who lost or against candidates who won.\n",
              "The foundation then produced a \"return on investment\" -- the percentage of the group’s money that was spent on races that ended with the group’s desired result.\n",
              "In 2012, a year when President Barack Obama won a second term and the Democrats held the Senate, a number of liberal groups fared well on this score: Affiliates of Planned Parenthood, the Service Employees International Union and the League of Conservation Voters finished with returns on investment of 80 percent and higher. By contrast, conservative or pro-business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce or the Karl Rove-founded American Crossroads finished with percentages in the single digits.\n",
              "So how did the NRA do? Sunlight looked at two of its affiliates -- the Political Victory Fund and the Institute for Legislative Action. (The two groups are organized under different parts of the tax code, but they have the same goal -- promoting candidates who support the NRA’s agenda.)\n",
              "According to Sunlight, the Political Victory Fund spent $11,159,493 but generated a minuscule 0.83 percent return on investment. A big reason for the poor showing was that more than four of every five dollars the group spent was either against Obama or for Mitt Romney in the presidential race, and of course Obama won.\n",
              "Meanwhile, the return on investment for the $7,448,017 spent by the Institute for Legislative Action was a bit higher -- 10.74 percent.\n",
              "So right off the bat, Jones’ summary is misleading -- one of the two NRA affiliates produced a success rate of better than 1 percent.\n",
              "But we see an even bigger concern: Jones was talking about endorsements, but the Sunlight Foundation was looking at money. And the NRA has endorsed candidates without necessarily spending money.\n",
              "In fact, while receiving money from the NRA is nice for any candidate that supports its goals, an NRA endorsement even in the absence of money is a treasured asset. Once an endorsement is made, a candidate can reap benefits among voters who trust the NRA. It can be touted on a campaign’s lawn signs, at candidate forums, in newspaper profiles and on social media.\n",
              "To more accurately gauge Jones’ claim about endorsements, we tried to assemble a more complete list of endorsements, regardless of whether they came attached to money.\n",
              "First, we tallied the number of candidates who had received funding (or found themselves targets of opposition funding) from either of the two NRA affiliates. Then we added any additional candidates for whom the NRA issued an endorsement news release in 2012. To remain in tune with Sunlight’s methodology, we limited our list to federal candidates only.\n",
              "Ultimately, we found 49 NRA endorsements that ended up as \"failures\" -- that is, where the group backed a losing candidate or failed to defeat a candidate they opposed. But the NRA notched an even higher number of \"successes\" in 2012 -- 72 candidates that the group helped carry to victory, or that it helped defeat. That’s about a 60 percent success rate for endorsements -- far higher than the 1 percent Jones cited., \"1.3-million people in America make their living off eBay.\" Asked during the second presidential debate whom he would consider for treasury secretary, Sen.

              "But it's not conceivable that the number of Americans making a living off eBay has climbed to 1.3-million. In 2005, the latest year for which statistics are available, just 724,000 Americans made money selling on eBay, according to a Nielsen study.

Randy Forbes, R-4th, is warning that potential cuts in defense spending would inflict mass destruction on the U.S. economy.\n",
              "Forbes, whose district is anchored in South Hampton Roads where military installations dominate the economy, unveiled a web ad saying the zeal to cut the nation’s debt has left U.S. defense vulnerable. The commercial says Congress must turn to other programs for savings, or face \"catastrophe. \"\n",
              "\"1.53 million jobs are at risk,\" the ad’s narrator says. \"Pink slips are waiting to be handed out.\"\n",
              "We wondered if 1.53 million defense jobs really are at risk in the latest round of federal budget negotiations. So we decided to take a look.\n",
              "First, a little background.\n",
              "After much debate in August, Congress agreed to raise the nation’s debt ceiling in return for long-range budget cuts. The first part of the deal called for reducing overall spending by $900 billion over the next 10 years, including about $400 billion in defense cuts. The defense budget is now about $700 billion a year.\n",
              "The legislation set up a 12-member, bipartisan super committee of senators and representatives to cut an additional $1.5 trillion in overall spending. If the group fails to reach consensus by Nov. 23, then $1.2 trillion in reductions will automatically occur -- half from defense and half from domestic programs. That cut to defense, combined with the $400 billion in reductions already agreed on, would mean a total loss of $1 trillion in defense money over the next 10 years.\n",
              "How does Forbes take that figure and compute job losses? Joe Hack, Forbes’ spokesman, pointed us to a comment by Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta in September that a $1 trillion defense cut could add 1 percent to the country’s unemployment rate.\n",
              "Hack then referred us to Bureau of Labor Statistics data showing the size of the U.S. labor force at about 154 million in September. Cutting 1 percent of that would lead to the loss of 1.53 million jobs, he said.\n",
              "We ran the numbers ourselves and found Forbes to be accurate.\n",
              "We came across other estimates that conclude $1 trillion in defense cuts would lead to significant layoffs, although not quite as high as Forbes states.\n",
              "The Department of Defenses says about 6 million jobs are supported by military spending, including 3.8 million private sector jobs, 700,000 Department of Defense jobs and 1.5 million active-duty service members outside of reserve units.\n",
              "\"Sequestration ($1 trillion in cuts) assumes across the board spending cuts with losses peaking in the 2013-2014 time period, with 1 million to 1.5 million jobs lost and that could increase the U.S. unemployment rate by nearly 1 percentage point in the near term,\" said Lt. Col. Elizabeth Robbins, a spokeswoman of the Department of Defense.\n",
              "So Forbes’ number is at the top end of what the Department of Defense estimates as far as job losses. It could be as high as 1.5 million but as low as 1 million, according to the Pentagon.\n",
              "We asked the Defense Department to direct us to any underlying reports showing how they arrived at their numbers for job losses and lower unemployment rate, but they didn’t provide any.\n",
              "The Aerospace Industries Association, which represents aerospace and defense companies, estimates $1 trillion in defense cuts would cause a loss of slightly more than 1 million jobs. Some layoffs would occur among defense industry contractors and suppliers, but the bulk -- some 653,570 jobs --  would be lost in communities due to the to the loss of payroll spending associated with those jobs, the report states.\n",
              "The report was authored by Stephen Fuller, director of the Center of Regional Analysis at George Mason University. In a response to questions from Forbes at a October 26 hearing before the House Armed Services Committee, Fuller said his job loss projections don’t include tallies of lost active duty members or civilians employed by the Department of Defense.\n",
              "In an October 14, 2011 op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, the House Armed Services Committee Chairman, Buck McKeon, R-Calif., said automatic cuts from sequestration \"would kill upwards of 800,000  of our active-duty, civilian and industrial American jobs.\"\n",
              "Claude Schafin, a House Armed Services Committee spokesman, said McKeon’s analysis doesn’t take into account any indirect layoffs in communities that would happen as a result of losses at the Department of Defense and their contractors.\n",
              "Projections of a 1 percent unemployment spike losses have drawn skepticism from some advocacy groups who charge they’re overblown.\n",
              "A study by Heidi Garrett-Peltier, a research professor at the University of Massachusetts, concludes the job losses from defense spending would be less than the Department of Defense estimates. Her work was funded by The Institute for Policy Studies, which says it advocates for a U.S. foreign policy based in part on demilitarization.\n",
              "In an interview Garrett-Peltier said a $1 trillion military cut over 10 years would cost about 860,000 jobs funded either directly or indirectly by the Department of Defense. If you include additional jobs losses in communities from a loss in spending from laid-off employees, the jobs loss would be 1.1 million, she said.\n",
              "Garrett-Peltier said government spending on defense does not generate as many jobs as investments in health care, education and other areas.\n",
              "\"Are we better off cutting $100 billion in the defense budget or from education, health care, clean energy?\" Garrett-Peltier said. \"We would lose more jobs (from domestic cuts) than cutting $100 billion a year in defense.\", \"1/3 of our kids drop out (of high school), cannot go to college or start a career.\" With the 2014 elections in the rear-view mirror and 2016 coming up fast, the political world has begun speculating about whether former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush -- son of one president and brother of a second -- could seek the White House himself.\n",
              "In a recent fundraising letter sent on behalf of the Excellence in Education Foundation, Bush discusses one of his signature issues.\n",
              "\"In order to have any lasting success, we must first transform our failing education system and have no tolerance for the adult-centered K-12 system that exists today.\n",
              "\"America's education system is a prime example of government that is completely out-of-control. Instead of focusing on what's best for our children, education in America is focused on the adults who organize in more than 13,000 heavily unionized government monopolies.\n",
              "\"As a result, America's high school graduation standards are shamefully low.\n",
              "\"Only 25% of America's high school graduates are college or career ready.\n",
              "\"1/3 of America's high school graduates need remediation.\n",
              "\"1/3 of our kids drop out, cannot go to college or start a career.\n",
              "\"This is a tragedy unfolding in our country in ways that will overwhelm us.\"\n",
              "This is a lot to chew on, but we decided to check one of these claims -- that one-third of American students \"drop out, cannot go to college or start a career.\"\n",
              "The problem, we quickly found, is that Bush’s one-third figure isn’t correct for dropouts alone, for those who do not go to college, or for the combination of the two.\n",
              "Before we look at the numbers, we should explain that there is more than one way to measure dropout frequency.\n",
              "One of the most common is the \"status dropout rate,\" which measures, at a specific point in time, what percent of people within a certain age range are dropouts.\n",
              "By this measure, Bush’s figure is significantly inflated. In 2012 , 6.6 percent of 16-to-24-year-olds were neither enrolled in school nor possessed an alternative high school credential such as a GED. That’s one-fifth of Bush’s number.\n",
              "Another way of measuring dropouts is to use the \"event dropout rate.\" This measures what percentage of people in an age range dropped out during the prior year. In 2011 -- the most recent year this statistic was calculated -- the percentage was 3 percent. That’s less than 10 percent of what Bush had said.\n",
              "So what’s going on here? When we asked Bush’s staff to explain their reasoning, they said that multiple reports show high numbers of minority students, black and Hispanic in particular, are not graduating from high school.\n",
              "It pointed to another federal estimate -- one that looks at how many public high school students who started as freshmen finished high school within four years. According to provisional data , the Averaged Freshman Graduation Rate, as it is known, found that 78.2 percent of of freshmen finished school in four years. That figure was 66.1 for black students and 71.4 percent for Hispanics. That flip side would be that nearly 34 percent of black freshmen and about 29 percent of Hispanic freshmen didn’t graduate in four years. Education Week data showed similar numbers for members of the high school class of 2012.\n",
              "However, the fundraising letter doesn’t mention anything about minority students. So the most appropriate number to use would be the overall number -- and that would be 19 percent to 22 percent, depending on the parameters you use. Either way, that’s well below one-third.\n",
              "Bush’s staff also pointed to data from the publishers of the ACT college-entrance exam . It found that 31 percent of those who graduated from high school and took the ACT were not ready for entry-level college courses in English, reading, math or science. However, ACT test-takers represent a fraction all of students, and it’s not wise to assume they’re the same, said David Bills, an education professor at the University of Iowa.\n",
              "Overall, Bills said, the Bush camp’s justifications strike him as cherry-picking. \"I think we’re getting a pretty motivated use of data,\" he said., \"10 cents on the dollar from the Clinton Foundation goes to charitable causes.\" In the vice presidential debate, Republican Mike Pence tried to skewer Hillary Clinton by talking about the multi-billion dollar Clinton Foundation. Pence recycled a flawed GOP talking point that the foundation is a cash cow to enrich the Clintons and their friends.\n",
              "\"10 cents on the dollar from the Clinton Foundation goes to charitable causes,\" Pence said.\n",
              "This is based on a misunderstanding of how the foundation operates. In brief, it raises money to deliver services and projects itself. The amount of money it gives away as grants is a small sliver of its activities.\n",
              "We’ll use the Clinton Foundation’s most recent IRS tax form, for 2014, as an example. (It starts on Page 28 of this document .) The foundation reported total expenses in 2014 of a little over $91 million but grants of just $5.1 million. That’s close to 6 percent of the foundation’s money being spent on grants.\n",
              "But that doesn’t mean everything else is overhead, people who monitor charities and their practices say, or that only 10 cents of every dollar went to a charitable cause.\n",
              "\"Although it has ‘foundation’ in its name, the Clinton Foundation is actually a public charity,\" Brian Mittendorf, a professor of accounting at Ohio State University’s Fisher College of Business, wrote in the Chronicle of Philanthropy . \"In practical terms, this means both that it relies heavily on donations from the public and that it achieves its mission primarily by using those donations to conduct direct charitable activities, as opposed to providing grants from an endowment.\"\n",
              "What are some of the foundation’s programs?\n",
              "The Clinton Development Initiative helps farmers in Malawi, Rwanda and Tanzania raise more crops and get higher prices at the market.\n",
              "The Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership launched the Acceso Centro de Formacion to provide job training for people in Cartagena, Colombia.\n",
              "The Clinton Health Access Initiative, for instance, has gotten credit for providing access to lower-cost drugs for millions of people with HIV/AIDS .\n",
              "Financial statement rules require a nonprofit to split its expenses between program services, fundraising and management/general costs (the latter two are collectively what are referred to as \"overhead\"), Mittendorf told us.\n",
              "He said that in 2014, 87.2 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s expenses were on program services.\n",
              "\"Of course, this only speaks to how the organization used its funds and not whether that 87.2 percent was allocated to the most effective program efforts, but it is all we have in terms of verifiable data on this question,\" Mittendorf said.\n",
              "The American Institute of Philanthropy’s Charity Watch, reached the same conclusion. It has given the Clinton Foundation an A rating and says it spends only 12 percent of the money it raises on \"overhead .\"\n",
              "\"The Clinton Foundation is an excellent charity,\" Charity Watch president Daniel Borochoff said Aug. 24, 2016, on CNN. \"They are able to get 88 percent of their spending to bona fide program services and their fundraising efficiency is really low. It only costs them $2 to raise $100.\"\n",
              "Other Republican critics of the foundation have used slightly higher figures than Pence. Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus said the foundation only spent 20 percent on good works. Conservative radio talker Rush Limbaugh said it was 15 percent. Those are inaccurate, too., \"100 percent of the crime is committed, in estimate, by about 15 percent of the population.\" Urging a positive view of law officers \"that you and your family depend on every day,\" Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick went on to say the vast majority of citizens are law-abiding.\n",
              "He put precise numbers on that. \"You know,\" Patrick said during a Sept. 2, 2015, interview with David Brown of the Texas Standard , a statewide news affairs program based at KUT, the NPR affiliate in Austin, \"100 percent of the crime is committed, in estimate, by about 15 percent of the population.\" (We have regularly talked about our fact checks on the program.)\n",
              "A curious listener emailed us. Could Patrick's 100/15 statement be so?\n",
              "Patrick’s backup\n",
              "Asked how Patrick reached his figures, his spokesman, Alejandro Garcia, said by email that Patrick \"uses 15% as the number of citizens that commit 100% of crime as an indicator of the number of criminals in the total population to make the point that most citizens are law-abiding. That is higher than statistics would indicate,\" Garcia said, writing that according to law enforcement data, \"we have approximately 2.2 million people in jail in America and another 5 million on probation and parole. That is roughly 2.5% of the total population that has been convicted of a crime including non-violent drug offenses.\"\n",
              "Garcia declined to elaborate on how that 2.5 percent justified Patrick’s 15 percent figure.\n",
              "The Bureau of Justice Statistics, part of the Justice Department, said in a December 2014 report that in 2013, 2.2 million people were incarcerated and more than 4.7 million people were under community supervision (on probation or parole). The report further says those counts (which roll in some people not convicted of crimes) equate to 2,830 people per 100,000 U.S. adults, meaning 2.8 percent of U.S. adults were under correctional supervision.\n",
              "That ratio was the lowest since at least 2005, when there were 3,160 people per 100,000 U.S. adults in the \"correctional population,\" the report said.\n",
              "A pair of criminologists told us the numbers offered by Patrick didn’t make a case for the unfamiliar 100/15 formulation.\n",
              "\"Gibberish,\" Candace McCoy , a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, commented by email, elaborating that the attempt to account for U.S. residents behind bars doesn’t necessarily support what Patrick declared on the air. \"I don't know how the two statistics supposedly relate to each other, if at all,\" McCoy said.\n",
              "Robert Brame , a University of South Carolina professor who has led research into young Americans arrested for non-traffic offenses, said by phone he didn’t see how the backup offered by Patrick \"addresses the fraction of the population that’s responsible for the crime problem in the United States.That’s not clear to me.\"\n",
              "Broadly, Brame and other criminologists we reached said they weren’t aware of a factual way to get to an accurate statement that ‘x’ percent of the population commits all the crime.\n",
              "But there have been studies suggesting a subset of residents commit about half of crimes. Alex Piquero, a criminologist at the University of Texas at Dallas, said by email: \"A routine finding in the criminological literature is that about half of the crime is committed by a very small fraction of the population, around 5-8 percent depending on the sample and methodology used. This finding has been replicated in many different studies around the world. The bottom line is that a small fraction of the offending population is responsible for a great majority of crime.\" Piquero said most of the studies tracked residents only into late adolescence or early adulthood.\n",
              "The Philadelphia studies and others\n",
              "Since the 1960s, researchers have probed how often youths come into police contact, consistently finding that a subset of people account for around half of the crimes reported to police.\n",
              "In the seminal \"Crime in a Birth Cohort\" and a followup study, a team led by University of Pennsylvania criminologist Marvin Wolfgang tracked nearly 10,000 boys born in 1945 and living in Philadelphia from age 10 through 17; they ultimately gauged how often each boy came in contact with police for an offense. One upshot: 627 boys, 6 percent of the group, each accounted for five or more offenses, according to police reports. Those boys, Wolfgang wrote, were collectively identified as responsible for 52 percent of all the offenses recorded in the study and, he said, about two-thirds of all violent crimes believed to have been committed by the juveniles. In Patrick-speak, Wolfgang found that 6 percent of juvenile boys accounted for about half of alleged juvenile crimes.\n",
              "The follow-up study , presented in progress in 1982, tracked more than 28,000 boys and girls born in 1958 who lived in Philadelphia from age 10 through 17. Among males, the study found, 61 percent of reported  offenses  were committed by 1,030 \"chronic recidivists,\" comprising 7 percent of males in the study. That is, 7 percent of the boys accounted for 61 percent of the juvenile offenses.\n",
              "David Farrington, a University of Cambridge professor of psychological criminology reported in 2006 on criminal offenses by 411 South London boys occasionally interviewed by the team starting when the subjects were 8 years old in 1961. The researchers, who also checked criminal records, found that a \"small proportion of the study males (7%) were defined as ‘chronic offenders’ because they accounted for about half of all officially recorded offenses\" in the study. The most common offenses, they wrote, included thefts, burglaries and car thefts followed by violence, vandalism, fraud and drug abuse.\n",
              "In 2014, Swedish researchers drawing on records accounting for the experiences of 2.5 million people born in that country from 1958 to 1980 reported that from 1973 to 2004, some 1 percent of the population accounted for 63 percent of all violent crime convictions. Researcher  Örjan Falk added: \"Psychotic disorders are twice as common among repeat offenders as in the general population, but despite this fact they constitute a very small proportion of the repeat offenders.\"\n",
              "In the United States, Brame in 2011 reported that based on interviews of a representative sample of residents aged 12 to 16 at the end of 1996, some 25 percent to 41 percent of participants had been arrested by the time they turned 23. Brame told us a widely quoted takeaway from the study was that by age 23, around 1 in 3 of people in that age group would have been arrested for a non-traffic offense at least once. Then again, it’s not a good idea, Brame told us, to assume the same figure would apply to young residents nowadays because teen crime and arrest rates were higher in the mid-1990s.\n",
              "Brame said another vital consideration in mulling how much of the population is responsible for all crime is that many crimes go unreported to police. In 2014, according to the 2014 National Crime Victimization Survey , only 37 percent of U.S. property victimizations and only 46 percent of violent victimizations were reported to police.\n",
              "To our inquiry, William Kelly , director of the University of Texas Center for Criminology and Criminal Justice Research, noted that according to the U.S. Sentencing Project , as many as 100 million U.S. residents, which in 2014 would have been equal to 41 percent of the adult population, had a criminal conviction., \"100% of heroin/fentanyl epidemic is because we don't have a WALL.\" In his State of the Union speech on Tuesday, President Donald Trump proposed a stricter immigration system that he says would keep Americans safer and help address the country’s opioid epidemic.\n",
              "Trump’s plan is built on four \"pillars,\" as he called them, one of which is a wall along America’s southern border.\n",
              "\"Our plan closes the terrible loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country,\" Trump said, adding shortly thereafter: \"These reforms will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction.\"\n",
              "The speech was roundly praised by conservative politicians and pundits, including Ann Coulter . Coulter is the author of several books and often appears on radio and television shows.\n",
              "While Trump’s speech didn’t linger on the relationship between opioids and Mexico, Coulter attempted to provide some context.\n",
              "\"Good he's talking about opioid crisis -- 100% of heroin/fentanyl epidemic is because we don't have a WALL,\" she tweeted.\n",
              "There are three claims to address here. One: the insinuation that the opioid crisis is limited to or caused by a rise in heroin and fentanyl use. Two: that all heroin and fentanyl used by Americans enters the country through Mexico. And three: the suggestion that building a wall along America’s southern border would drastically reduce opioid abuse.\n",
              "What are opioids?\n",
              "The National Institute on Drug Abuse describes opioids as a class of drugs that includes heroin , fentanyl and prescription pain relievers such as oxycodone (including OxyContin), hydrocodone (including Vicodin), codeine, morphine, and many others. Fentanyl is a powerful synthetic opioid pain reliever that is similar to morphine but is 50 to 100 times more potent.\n",
              "More than 64,000 people died in 2016 from drug overdoses , the majority of which were linked to opioids, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Trump declared the opioid epidemic a public health emergency Oct. 26 at the White House.\n",
              "What caused the epidemic?\n",
              "According to the final report by the U.S. Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis, a commission Trump created, the current epidemic is a result of \"excessive prescribing of opioids since 1999\" compounded by the \"widespread availability of inexpensive and purer illicit heroin; the influx of highly potent fentanyl/fentanyl analogs.\"\n",
              "The commission included former Republican New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, the chairman, Republican Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker, Democratic North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, former Democratic Congressman Patrick J. Kennedy of Massachusetts, Republican Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, and Bertha Madras, an opioid expert and professor of psychobiology in the Department of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.\n",
              "\"Examining national-level general population heroin data (including those in and not in treatment), nearly 80 percent of heroin users reported using prescription opioids prior to heroin,\" the Institute on Drug Abuse notes on a webpage explaining prescription opioids as a gateway drug.\n",
              "In 2015 alone, the Institute says, an estimated 2 million people in the United States suffered from substance use disorders related to prescription opioid pain relievers, and 591,000 suffered from a heroin use disorder (the stats aren’t mutually exclusive).\n",
              "Where do heroin and fentanyl come from?\n",
              "International gangs based in Mexico \"remain the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States,\" and their most common method of smuggling drugs is vehicles legally coming into the U.S., according to a 2017 Drug Enforcement Administration report .\n",
              "And, as PolitiFact previously reported , heroin is most smuggled through Mexico.\n",
              "\"Opium poppy cultivation and heroin production in Mexico, believed to be the primary source of heroin for the U.S. market, have continued to surge, providing traffickers a steady stream of high-purity, low-cost heroin to market throughout the United States,\" the report says.\n",
              "As for fentanyl, it mainly originates in China and comes in through the southwest border, Canada and the U.S. Postal Service.\n",
              "Trump’s opioid commission says many users are ordering the pill-form of fentanyl online and having it shipped discreetly. The commission’s report references a Carnegie Mellon University study which found that revenues from online illicit drug sales increased from between $15-17 million in 2012 to $150-$180 million in 2015.\n",
              "Furthermore, the fentanyl found at the southern border tends to be less potent than the fentanyl shipped through the mail.\n",
              "\"Large volumes of fentanyl are seized at the [southern border], although these seizures are typically low in purity – on average approximately 7 percent,\" the DEA’s 2017 report says.\n",
              "\"Conversely, the smaller volumes seized after arriving in the mail directly from China can have purities over 90 percent and be worth much more than the fentanyl seized at the SWB.\"\n",
              "Would a wall work?\n",
              "Probably not.\n",
              "Trump has said that building a wall between the United States and Mexico would curb opioid use in America, and experts told PolitiFact in October they’re skeptical a wall would have a drastic impact.\n",
              "Even though a lot of heroin comes from Mexico, it’s not always walked across the border. As PolitiFact pointed out in this fact check of Trump , traffickers typically smuggle the drugs in through secret compartments in vehicles crossing the border (through legal checkpoints and illegal crossings), transport them to stash houses in hub cities like Dallas, Los Angeles and Phoenix, and then distribute to the Midwest and East Coast.\n",
              "\"Traffickers hide their illicit cargo in secret, state–of–the art compartments designed for cars, or under legal goods in trailer trucks. And they have learned many techniques for fooling the border patrol,\" Vanda Felbab-Brown wrote in an August 2017 essay for the Brookings Institute, a nonprofit public policy organization based in Washington, DC.\n",
              "As Trump once accurately noted , smugglers also attempt to get drugs into the United States using catapults, drones, boats and tunnels. At least 232 tunnels were discovered on U.S. borders from 1990 to January 2017, according to the 2017 DEA report.\n",
              "The report notes that the most common method employed by Mexican traffickers \"involves transporting illicit drugs through U.S. ports of entry (POEs) in passenger vehicles with concealed compartments or commingled with legitimate goods on tractor trailers.\"\n",
              "As for fentanyl, Trump’s opioid commission seemed more concerned with shipments from China than couriers from Mexico.\n",
              "\"We are losing this fight predominately through China,\" the commission wrote in its interim report.\n",
              "\"This must become a top tier diplomatic issue with the Chinese; American lives are at stake and it threatens our national security,\" it says. \"Our inability to reliably detect fentanyl at our land borders and at our international mail handling facilities creates untenable vulnerabilities.\"\n",
              "Josh Stein, North Carolina’s Democratic attorney general, summarized the issue in an email.\n",
              "\"Traffickers predominately bring heroin from Mexico but usually through legal points of entry. Drug dealers import illicit fentanyl from China usually by air. To effectively combat the opioid epidemic … there are better investments than a wall.\", \"101 utilities cut rates, credit GOP tax cuts.\" For months, President Donald Trump has been touting the benefits of the tax law he signed in December. But in early June, he began expanding his argument beyond lower tax bills to lower energy bills.\n",
              "On June 7, Trump tweeted , \"$3 billion payoff: 101 utilities cut rates, credit GOP tax cuts.\" The tweet linked to a Washington Examiner article that in turn cited research by Americans for Tax Reform , a group supportive of the tax cut.\n",
              "This isn’t the first time the White House has relied on Americans for Tax Reform for evidence of real-world impacts from passage of the tax bill. Previously, we looked at Trump’s statement that \"since we passed tax cuts, over 3 million workers have gotten tax cut bonuses — many of them thousands and thousands of dollars.\" That talking point, gleaned from the group’s research , rated Mostly True .\n",
              "The energy rate-cut list — which is a sub-list of the broader one we checked previously — attracted the White House’s attention not long after it hit its 100th item.\n",
              "For the utilities on the group's list that provided an estimate of savings per customer, most said rate-payers would save about $1 to $4 on their bill per month.\n",
              "Americans for Tax Reform cited a large number of company news releases and news articles, so we don’t quarrel with the number (which had already grown to 102 a day later).\n",
              "That said, we will provide some additional information that helps put the list in fuller context.\n",
              "It shouldn’t be surprising to see a lot of investor-owned utilities lowering rates after the corporate tax reduction. And it also shouldn’t be surprising that the companies specifically cited the tax changes as the reason for the rate cut. In most cases, experts said, utilities would have been required to do so by their regulators.\n",
              "The tax law has an impact on privately owned utilities — often called \"investor-owned utilities,\" or IOUs for short — but not on public utilities.\n",
              "Investor-owned utilities pay corporate taxes, so the tax law’s lowering of the top corporate rate from 35 percent to 21 percent should save this type of utility a substantial amount of money.\n",
              "By contrast, publicly held utilities do not pay corporate taxes, so they are unaffected by this provision of the tax bill. Public utilities include rural electric cooperatives, municipally owned utilities, and federal or state power authorities.\n",
              "Among electricity utilities, about two-thirds of Americans are served by investor-owned utilities, while about a third receive their power from public utilities. For water utilities, a few of which appear on the group's list, public utilities are dominant.\n",
              "So while 101 utilities cutting their rates may seem like a large number, your ability to benefit from a rate cut depends on which utilities happen to serve your area.\n",
              "It’s also worth pointing out that many of these rate cuts were preordained by existing energy regulations.\n",
              "\"Utilities are natural monopolies, and because of that, they’ve been regulated for well over 100 years,\" said Manny Teodoro, a political scientist at Texas A&M University who has studied energy issues. \"It’s a recognition that a pure monopoly will result in a lack of competition and abusive pricing.\"\n",
              "For that reason, under longstanding regulations, utilities need to go back to energy regulatory bodies whenever they seek to modify their rates, in order to provide reasons for the change. And if a utility happens to benefit from a tax change, there’s a good chance it will be required under existing regulations to lower their rates to account for that.\n",
              "\"Rates are set by public utility commissions through rate-making processes that would clearly identify the reasons for the rate change, up or down,\" said Billy Pizer, a Duke University public policy professor who studies energy.\n",
              "This doesn’t undercut the larger point of the tally, but it does suggest that the rate cuts required two elements to materialize — the tax cut, which Trump touted, and the longstanding regulations that require companies to share the tax gains with ratepayers rather than just with shareholders. And the latter is an aspect Trump didn’t get into., \"104 House Democrats voted for impeachment before the Ukraine call took place.\" On Dec. 18, 2019, the U.S. House of Representatives took a step it has only taken twice before in the history of the nation: impeaching the president.\n",
              "The impeachment grew out of a whistleblower complaint filed Aug. 12, 2019 that described a July 25 phone call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump asked Zelensky to look into activities in Ukraine by Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden’s son Hunter.\n",
              "The complaint surfaced publicly in late September, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked for a formal impeachment inquiry just days later.\n",
              "But U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, a Republican who has represented a suburban Milwaukee district in Congress since 1979, claimed that more than 100 Democrats took an earlier vote to impeach.\n",
              "On Dec. 11, 2019, Sensenbrenner tweeted an image that read: \"104 House Democrats voted for impeachment before the Ukraine call took place.\" He captioned it #ShamImpeachment.\n",
              "Many Republicans — and Trump himself — have argued Democrats made up their minds long ago on whether to impeach the president. But Sensenbrenner’s claim puts an entirely new framework on it, saying many had already voted for impeachment.\n",
              "Is he correct? Let’s unpack his argument.\n",
              "Early impeachment talk\n",
              "The first proposed article of impeachment related to Trump was introduced by U.S. Reps. Brad Sherman, D-California, and Al Green, D-Texas, on July 12, 2017.\n",
              "It focused on Trump’s firing of FBI director James Comey, who was overseeing an examination looking into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n",
              "The measure never moved further than its introduction, but the tide turned when Democrats took over the House after the 2018 midterm elections.\n",
              "Sherman reintroduced the bill Jan. 3, 2019 — the day the new Congress was sworn in.\n",
              "It was the same day freshman Rep. Rashida Talib, D-Michigan, made headlines when she declared — at a party hosted by the liberal group MoveOn — that \"we’re going to impeach the motherf*****.\"\n",
              "Green would bring a similar measure back several more times, but Democrats — including Pelosi — generally resisted calls to launch an impeachment inquiry.\n",
              "The impeachment votes that never were\n",
              "When asked to provide backup for Sensenbrenner’s claim, his communications director Christopher Krepich pointed to three roll call votes in the House as evidence.\n",
              "The first, which took place Dec. 6, 2017, was on a motion to table a measure from Green calling for Trump’s impeachment for \"high misdemeanors.\" The motion passed 364-58, with four voting \"present\" and six not voting, meaning any debate on the bill was suspended.\n",
              "The second vote, on Jan. 19, 2018, was nearly identical: A bill from Green to impeach Trump was tabled again.\n",
              "The third vote took place just days before the Ukraine call, on July 17, 2019. Yet again, Green’s bill was tabled, this time by a 332-95 vote, with one voting \"present\" and four not voting.\n",
              "Indeed, tallying the \"no\" votes from each of those roll calls and excluding those who either left or lost their seats in the 2018 midterm elections, that number comes to 103 Democrats. So, numerically, Sensenbrenner is basically right.\n",
              "But his characterization is, well, basically wrong.\n",
              "His spokesman, Krepich, argued a \"no\" vote on postponing the bills equals a vote to proceed on impeachment.\n",
              "Experts we consulted told us voting against a motion to table isn’t actually a vote in favor of a resolution.\n",
              "\"In voting to oppose tabling a measure, that is literally an expression of support for continuing consideration of a measure,\" said Sarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University and a senior fellow at the left-leaning Brookings Institute, in an email. \"It is not technically a direct vote on the substance of the resolution.\"\n",
              "That is, there never was a vote on the merits of any of Green’s measures.\n",
              "Frank Bowman, a law professor at the University of Missouri, said it’s more likely the votes against tabling the measures were a way of signalling support for an inquiry — not a vote \"for impeachment.\"\n",
              "To be sure, all of the Democrats cited by Sensenbrenner ultimately voted for both articles of impeachment, which now move to the U.S. Senate for trial.\n",
              "Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University, said the fact that prior to the Ukraine call Democrats were thinking about impeachment doesn’t have any bearing on the validity of the current impeachment.\n",
              "\"People who supported impeaching him for his previous wrongdoing are not somehow debarred from doing so in the present case,\" Somin wrote in an email., ...]\n",
